                 The Web Application Messaging Protocol
                  draft-oberstet-hybi-crossbar-wamp-02

Abstract

   This document defines the Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP).
   WAMP is a routed protocol that provides two messaging patterns:
   Publish & Subscribe and routed Remote Procedure Calls.  It is
   intended to connect application components in distributed
   applications.  WAMP uses WebSocket as its default transport, but can
   be transmitted via any other protocol that allows for ordered,
   reliable, bi-directional, and message-oriented communications.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background

   _This section is non-normative._

   The WebSocket protocol brings bi-directional real-time connections to
   the browser.  It defines an API at the message level, requiring users
   who want to use WebSocket connections in their applications to define
   their own semantics on top of it.

   The Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP) is intended to provide
   application developers with the semantics they need to handle
   messaging between components in distributed applications.

   WAMP was initially defined as a WebSocket sub-protocol, which
   provided Publish & Subscribe (PubSub) functionality as well as Remote
   Procedure Calls (RPC) for procedures implemented in a WAMP router.
   Feedback from implementers and users of this was included in a second
   version of the protocol which this document defines.  Among the
   changes was that WAMP can now run over any transport which is
   message-oriented, ordered, reliable, and bi-directional.

   WAMP is a routed protocol, with all components connecting to a _WAMP
   Router_, where the WAMP Router performs message routing between the
   components.

   WAMP provides two messaging patterns: _Publish & Subscribe_ and
   _routed Remote Procedure Calls_.

   Publish & Subscribe (PubSub) is an established messaging pattern
   where a component, the _Subscriber_, informs the router that it wants
   to receive information on a topic (i.e., it subscribes to a topic).
   Another component, a _Publisher_, can then publish to this topic, and
   the router distributes events to all Subscribers.

   Routed Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) rely on the same sort of
   decoupling that is used by the Publish & Subscribe pattern.  A
   component, the _Callee_, announces to the router that it provides a
   certain procedure, identified by a procedure name.  Other components,
   _Callers_, can then call the procedure, with the router invoking the
   procedure on the Callee, receiving the procedure's result, and then
   forwarding this result back to the Caller.  Routed RPCs differ from
   traditional client-server RPCs in that the router serves as an
   intermediary between the Caller and the Callee.

   The decoupling in routed RPCs arises from the fact that the Caller is
   no longer required to have knowledge of the Callee; it merely needs
   to know the identifier of the procedure it wants to call.  There is
   also no longer a need for a direct connection between the caller and
   the callee, since all traffic is routed.  This enables the calling of
   procedures in components which are not reachable externally (e.g. on
   a NATted connection) but which can establish an outgoing connection
   to the WAMP router.

   Combining these two patterns into a single protocol allows it to be
   used for the entire messaging requirements of an application, thus
   reducing technology stack complexity, as well as networking
   overheads.

1.2.  Protocol Overview

   _This section is non-normative._

   The PubSub messaging pattern defines three roles: _Subscribers_ and
   _Publishers_, which communicate via a _Broker_.

   The routed RPC messaging pattern also defines three roles: _Callers_
   and _Callees_, which communicate via a _Dealer_.

   A _Router_ is a component which implements one or both of the Broker
   and Dealer roles.  A _Client_ is a component which implements any or
   all of the Subscriber, Publisher, Caller, or Callee roles.

   WAMP _Connections_ are established by Clients to a Router.
   Connections can use any _transport_ that is message-based, ordered,
   reliable and bi-directional, with WebSocket as the default transport.

   WAMP _Sessions_ are established over a WAMP Connection.  A WAMP
   Session is joined to a _Realm_ on a Router.  Routing occurs only
   between WAMP Sessions that have joined the same Realm.

   The _WAMP Basic Profile_ defines the parts of the protocol that are
   required to establish a WAMP connection, as well as for basic
   interactions between the four client and two router roles.  WAMP
   implementations are required to implement the Basic Profile, at
   minimum.

   The _WAMP Advanced Profile_ defines additions to the Basic Profile
   which greatly extend the utility of WAMP in real-world applications.
   WAMP implementations may support any subset of the Advanced Profile
   features.  They are required to announce those supported features
   during session establishment.

1.3.  Design Philosophy

   _This section is non-normative._

   WAMP was designed to be performant, safe and easy to implement.  Its
   entire design was driven by a implement, get feedback, adjust cycle.

   An initial version of the protocol was publicly released in March
   2012.  The intent was to gain insight through implementation and use,
   and integrate these into a second version of the protocol, where
   there would be no regard for compatibility between the two versions.
   Several interoperable, independent implementations were released, and
   feedback from the implementers and users was collected.

   The second version of the protocol, which this RFC covers, integrates
   this feedback.  Routed Remote Procedure Calls are one outcome of
   this, where the initial version of the protocol only allowed the
   calling of procedures provided by the router.  Another, related
   outcome was the strict separation of routing and application logic.

   While WAMP was originally developed to use WebSocket as a transport,
   with JSON for serialization, experience in the field revealed that
   other transports and serialization formats were better suited to some
   use cases.  For instance, with the use of WAMP in the Internet of
   Things sphere, resource constraints play a much larger role than in
   the browser, so any reduction of resource usage in WAMP
   implementations counts.  This lead to the decoupling of WAMP from any
   particular transport or serialization, with the establishment of
   minimum requirements for both.

1.3.1.  Basic and Advanced Profiles

   This document first describes a Basic Profile for WAMP in its
   entirety, before describing an Advanced Profile which extends the
   basic functionality of WAMP.

   The separation into Basic and Advanced Profiles is intended to extend
   the reach of the protocol.  It allows implementations to start out
   with a minimal, yet operable and useful set of features, and to
   expand that set from there.  It also allows implementations that are
   tailored for resource-constrained environments, where larger feature
   sets would not be possible.  Here implementers can weigh between
   resource constraints and functionality requirements, then implement
   an optimal feature set for the circumstances.

   Advanced Profile features are announced during session establishment,
   so that different implementations can adjust their interactions to
   fit the commonly supported feature set.

1.3.2.  Application Code

   WAMP is designed for application code to run within Clients, i.e.
   _Peers_ having the roles Callee, Caller, Publisher, and Subscriber.

   Routers, i.e. Peers of the roles Brokers and Dealers are responsible
   for *generic call and event routing* and do not run application code.

   This allows the transparent exchange of Broker and Dealer
   implementations without affecting the application and to distribute
   and deploy application components flexibly.

      Note that a *program* that implements, for instance, the Dealer
      role might at the same time implement, say, a built-in Callee.  It
      is the Dealer and Broker that are generic, not the program.

1.3.3.  Language Agnostic

   WAMP is language agnostic, i.e. can be implemented in any programming
   language.  At the level of arguments that may be part of a WAMP
   message, WAMP takes a 'superset of all' approach.  WAMP
   implementations may support features of the implementing language for
   use in arguments, e.g. keyword arguments.

1.3.4.  Router Implementation Specifics

   This specification only deals with the protocol level.  Specific WAMP
   Broker and Dealer implementations may differ in aspects such as
   support for:

   o  router networks (clustering and federation),

   o  authentication and authorization schemes,

   o  message persistence, and,

   o  management and monitoring.

   The definition and documentation of such Router features is outside
   the scope of this document.

1.4.  Relationship to WebSocket

   WAMP uses WebSocket as its default transport binding, and is a
   registered WebSocket subprotocol.

2.  Conformance Requirements

   All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-
   normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative.
   Everything else in this specification is normative.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as
   "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort these
   steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word
   ("MUST", "SHOULD", "MAY", etc.) used in introducing the algorithm.

   Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps MAY
   be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is
   equivalent.

2.1.  Terminology and Other Conventions

   Key terms such as named algorithms or definitions are indicated like
   _this_ when they first occur, and are capitalized throughout the
   text.

3.  Realms, Sessions and Transports

   A Realm is a WAMP routing and administrative domain, optionally
   protected by authentication and authorization.  WAMP messages are
   only routed within a Realm.

   A Session is a transient conversation between two Peers attached to a
   Realm and running over a Transport.

   A Transport connects two WAMP Peers and provides a channel over which
   WAMP messages for a WAMP Session can flow in both directions.

   WAMP can run over any Transport which is message-based,
   bidirectional, reliable and ordered.

   The default transport for WAMP is WebSocket [RFC6455], where WAMP is
   an officially registered [1] subprotocol.

4.  Peers and Roles

   A WAMP Session connects two Peers, a Client and a Router.  Each WAMP
   Peer MUST implement one role, and MAY implement more roles.

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   A Client MAY implement any combination of the Roles:

   o  Callee

   o  Caller

   o  Publisher

   o  Subscriber

   and a Router MAY implement either or both of the Roles:

   o  Dealer

   o  Broker

      This document describes WAMP as in client-to-router communication.
      Direct client-to-client communication is not supported by WAMP.
      Router-to-router communication MAY be defined by a specific router
      implementation.

4.1.  Symmetric Messaging

   It is important to note that though the establishment of a Transport
   might have a inherent asymmetry (like a TCP client establishing a
   WebSocket connection to a server), and Clients establish WAMP
   sessions by attaching to Realms on Routers, WAMP itself is designed
   to be fully symmetric for application components.

   After the transport and a session have been established, any
   application component may act as Caller, Callee, Publisher and
   Subscriber at the same time.  And Routers provide the fabric on top
   of which WAMP runs a symmetric application messaging service.

4.2.  Remote Procedure Call Roles

   The Remote Procedure Call messaging pattern involves peers of three
   different roles:

   o  Callee (Client)

   o  Caller (Client)

   o  Dealer (Router)

   A Caller issues calls to remote procedures by providing the procedure
   URI and any arguments for the call.  The Callee will execute the

   procedure using the supplied arguments to the call and return the
   result of the call to the Caller.

   Callees register procedures they provide with Dealers.  Callers
   initiate procedure calls first to Dealers.  Dealers route calls
   incoming from Callers to Callees implementing the procedure called,
   and route call results back from Callees to Callers.

   The Caller and Callee will usually run application code, while the
   Dealer works as a generic router for remote procedure calls
   decoupling Callers and Callees.

4.3.  Publish & Subscribe Roles

   The Publish & Subscribe messaging pattern involves peers of three
   different roles:

   o  Subscriber (Client)

   o  Publisher (Client)

   o  Broker (Router)

   A Publisher publishes events to topics by providing the topic URI and
   any payload for the event.  Subscribers of the topic will receive the
   event together with the event payload.

   Subscribers subscribe to topics they are interested in with Brokers.
   Publishers initiate publication first at Brokers.  Brokers route
   events incoming from Publishers to Subscribers that are subscribed to
   respective topics.

   The Publisher and Subscriber will usually run application code, while
   the Broker works as a generic router for events decoupling Publishers
   from Subscribers.

4.4.  Peers with multiple Roles

   Note that Peers might implement more than one role: e.g. a Peer might
   act as Caller, Publisher and Subscriber at the same time.  Another
   Peer might act as both a Broker and a Dealer.

5.  Building Blocks

   WAMP is defined with respect to the following building blocks

   1.  Identifiers




Oberstein & Goedde      Expires October 20, 2018               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   2.  Serializations

   3.  Transports

   For each building block, WAMP only assumes a defined set of
   requirements, which allows to run WAMP variants with different
   concrete bindings.

5.1.  Identifiers

5.1.1.  URIs

   WAMP needs to identify the following persistent resources:

   1.  Topics

   2.  Procedures

   3.  Errors

   These are identified in WAMP using Uniform Resource Identifiers
   (URIs) [RFC3986] that MUST be Unicode strings.

      When using JSON as WAMP serialization format, URIs (as other
      strings) are transmitted in UTF-8 [RFC3629] encoding.

   _Examples_

   o  "com.myapp.mytopic1"

   o  "com.myapp.myprocedure1"

   o  "com.myapp.myerror1"

   The URIs are understood to form a single, global, hierarchical
   namespace for WAMP.

      The namespace is unified for topics, procedures and errors - these
      different resource types do NOT have separate namespaces.

   To avoid resource naming conflicts, the package naming convention
   from Java is used, where URIs SHOULD begin with (reversed) domain
   names owned by the organization defining the URI.

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


5.1.1.1.  Relaxed/Loose URIs

   URI components (the parts between two "."s, the head part up to the
   first ".", the tail part after the last ".") MUST NOT contain a ".",
   "#" or whitespace characters and MUST NOT be empty (zero-length
   strings).

      The restriction not to allow "." in component strings is due to
      the fact that "." is used to separate components, and WAMP
      associates semantics with resource hierarchies, such as in
      pattern-based subscriptions that are part of the Advanced Profile.
      The restriction not to allow empty (zero-length) strings as
      components is due to the fact that this may be used to denote
      wildcard components with pattern-based subscriptions and
      registrations in the Advanced Profile.  The character "#" is not
      allowed since this is reserved for internal use by Dealers and
      Brokers.

   As an example, the following regular expression could be used in
   Python to check URIs according to the above rules:

       <CODE BEGINS>
           ## loose URI check disallowing empty URI components
           pattern = re.compile(r"^([^\s\.#]+\.)*([^\s\.#]+)$")
       <CODE ENDS>

   When empty URI components are allowed (which is the case for specific
   messages that are part of the Advanced Profile), this following
   regular expression can be used (shown used in Python):

       <CODE BEGINS>
           ## loose URI check allowing empty URI components
           pattern = re.compile(r"^(([^\s\.#]+\.)|\.)*([^\s\.#]+)?$")
       <CODE ENDS>

5.1.1.2.  Strict URIs

   While the above rules MUST be followed, following a stricter URI rule
   is recommended: URI components SHOULD only contain lower-case
   letters, digits and "_".

   As an example, the following regular expression could be used in
   Python to check URIs according to the above rules:

       <CODE BEGINS>
           ## strict URI check disallowing empty URI components
           pattern = re.compile(r"^([0-9a-z_]+\.)*([0-9a-z_]+)$")
       <CODE ENDS>

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   When empty URI components are allowed (which is the case for specific
   messages that are part of the Advanced Profile), the following
   regular expression can be used (shown in Python):

       <CODE BEGINS>
           ## strict URI check allowing empty URI components
           pattern = re.compile(r"^(([0-9a-z_]+\.)|\.)*([0-9a-z_]+)?$")
       <CODE ENDS>

      Following the suggested regular expression will make URI
      components valid identifiers in most languages (modulo URIs
      starting with a digit and language keywords) and the use of lower-
      case only will make those identifiers unique in languages that
      have case-insensitive identifiers.  Following this suggestion can
      allow implementations to map topics, procedures and errors to the
      language environment in a completely transparent way.

5.1.1.3.  Reserved URIs

   Further, application URIs MUST NOT use "wamp" as a first URI
   component, since this is reserved for URIs predefined with the WAMP
   protocol itself.

   _Examples_

   o  "wamp.error.not_authorized"

   o  "wamp.error.procedure_already_exists"

5.1.2.  IDs

   WAMP needs to identify the following ephemeral entities each in the
   scope noted:

   1.  Sessions (_global scope_)

   2.  Publications (_global scope_)

   3.  Subscriptions (_router scope_)

   4.  Registrations (_router scope_)

   5.  Requests (_session scope_)

   These are identified in WAMP using IDs that are integers between
   (inclusive) *1* and *2^53* (9007199254740992):





Oberstein & Goedde      Expires October 20, 2018               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   o  IDs in the _global scope_ MUST be drawn _randomly_ from a _uniform
      distribution_ over the complete range [1, 2^53]

   o  IDs in the _router scope_ CAN be chosen freely by the specific
      router implementation

   o  IDs in the _session scope_ MUST be incremented by 1 beginning with
      1 (for each direction - _Client-to-Router_ and _Router-to-Client_)

      The reason to choose the specific lower bound as 1 rather than 0
      is that 0 is the null-like (falsy) value for many programming
      languages.  The reason to choose the specific upper bound is that
      2^53 is the largest integer such that this integer and _all_
      (positive) smaller integers can be represented exactly in IEEE-754
      doubles.  Some languages (e.g.  JavaScript) use doubles as their
      sole number type.  Most languages do have signed and unsigned
      64-bit integer types that both can hold any value from the
      specified range.

   The following is a complete list of usage of IDs in the three
   categories for all WAMP messages.  For a full definition of these see
   Section 6.

5.1.2.1.  Global Scope IDs

   o  "WELCOME.Session"

   o  "PUBLISHED.Publication"

   o  "EVENT.Publication"

5.1.2.2.  Router Scope IDs

   o  "EVENT.Subscription"

5.1.2.3.  Session Scope IDs

   o  "ERROR.Request"

   o  "PUBLISH.Request"

   o  "PUBLISHED.Request"

   o  "SUBSCRIBE.Request"

   o  "SUBSCRIBED.Request"

   o  "UNSUBSCRIBE.Request"

   o  "CANCEL.Request"

   o  "RESULT.Request"

   o  "UNREGISTER.Request"

   o  "UNREGISTERED.Request"

   o  "INVOCATION.Request"

   o  "INTERRUPT.Request"

   o  "YIELD.Request"

5.2.  Serializations

   WAMP is a message based protocol that requires serialization of
   messages to octet sequences to be sent out on the wire.

   A message serialization format is assumed that (at least) provides
   the following types:

   o  "integer" (non-negative)

   o  "string" (UTF-8 encoded Unicode)




Oberstein & Goedde      Expires October 20, 2018               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   o  "bool"

   o  "list"

   o  "dict" (with string keys)

      WAMP _itself_ only uses the above types, e.g. it does not use the
      JSON data types "number" (non-integer) and "null".  The
      _application payloads_ transmitted by WAMP (e.g. in call arguments
      or event payloads) may use other types a concrete serialization
      format supports.

   There is no required serialization or set of serializations for WAMP
   implementations (but each implementation MUST, of course, implement
   at least one serialization format).  Routers SHOULD implement more
   than one serialization format, enabling components using different
   kinds of serializations to connect to each other.

   WAMP defines two bindings for message serialization:

   1.  JSON

   2.  MessagePack

   Other bindings for serialization may be defined in future WAMP
   versions.

5.2.1.  JSON

   With JSON serialization, each WAMP message is serialized according to
   the JSON specification as described in RFC4627.

   Further, binary data follows a convention for conversion to JSON
   strings.  For details see the Appendix.

5.2.2.  MessagePack

   With MessagePack serialization, each WAMP message is serialized
   according to the MessagePack specification.

      Version 5 or later of MessagePack MUST BE used, since this version
      is able to differentiate between strings and binary values.

5.3.  Transports

   WAMP assumes a transport with the following characteristics:

   1.  message-based



Oberstein & Goedde      Expires October 20, 2018               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   2.  reliable

   3.  ordered

   4.  bidirectional (full-duplex)

   There is no required transport or set of transports for WAMP
   implementations (but each implementation MUST, of course, implement
   at least one transport).  Routers SHOULD implement more than one
   transport, enabling components using different kinds of transports to
   connect in an application.

5.3.1.  WebSocket Transport

   The default transport binding for WAMP is WebSocket ([RFC6455]).

   In the Basic Profile, WAMP messages are transmitted as WebSocket
   messages: each WAMP message is transmitted as a separate WebSocket
   message (not WebSocket frame).  The Advanced Profile may define other
   modes, e.g. a *batched mode* where multiple WAMP messages are
   transmitted via single WebSocket message.

   The WAMP protocol MUST BE negotiated during the WebSocket opening
   handshake between Peers using the WebSocket subprotocol negotiation
   mechanism ([RFC6455] section 4).

   WAMP uses the following WebSocket subprotocol identifiers for
   unbatched modes:

   o  "wamp.2.json"

   o  "wamp.2.msgpack"

   With "wamp.2.json", _all_ WebSocket messages MUST BE of type *text*
   (UTF8 encoded payload) and use the JSON message serialization.

   With "wamp.2.msgpack", _all_ WebSocket messages MUST BE of type
   *binary* and use the MessagePack message serialization.

      To avoid incompatibilities merely due to naming conflicts with
      WebSocket subprotocol identifiers, implementers SHOULD register
      identifiers for additional serialization formats with the official
      WebSocket subprotocol registry.

5.3.2.  Transport and Session Lifetime

   WAMP implementations MAY choose to tie the lifetime of the underlying
   transport connection for a WAMP connection to that of a WAMP session,
   i.e. establish a new transport-layer connection as part of each new
   session establishment.  They MAY equally choose to allow re-use of a
   transport connection, allowing subsequent WAMP sessions to be
   established using the same transport connection.

   The diagram below illustrates the full transport connection and
   session lifecycle for an implementation which uses WebSocket over TCP
   as the transport and allows the re-use of a transport connection.

5.3.3.  Protocol errors

   WAMP implementations MUST close sessions (disposing all of their
   resources such as subscriptions and registrations) on protocol errors
   caused by offending peers.

   Following scenarios have to be considered protocol errors:

   o  Receiving "WELCOME" message, after session was established.

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   o  Receiving "HELLO" message, after session was established.

   o  Receiving "CHALLENGE" message, after session was established.

   o  Receiving "GOODBYE" message, before session was established.

   o  Receiving "ERROR" message, before session was established.

   o  Receiving "ERROR" message with invalid REQUEST.Type.

   o  Receiving "SUBSCRIBED" message, before session was established.

   o  Receiving "UNSUBSCRIBED" message, before session was established.

   o  Receiving "PUBLISHED" message, before session was established.

   o  Receiving "RESULT" message, before session was established.

   o  Receiving "REGISTERED" message, before session was established.

   o  Receiving "UNREGISTERED" message, before session was established.

   o  Receiving "INVOCATION" message, before session was established.

   o  Receiving protocol incompatible message, such as empty array,
      invalid WAMP message type id, etc.

   o  Catching error during message encoding/decoding.

   o  Any other exceptional scenario explicitly defined in any relevant
      section of this specification below (such as receiving a second
      "HELLO" within the lifetime of a session).

   In all such cases WAMP implementations:

   1.  MUST send an "ABORT" message to the offending peer, having reason
       "wamp.error.protocol_violation" and optional attributes in
       ABORT.Details such as a human readable error message.

   2.  MUST close the WAMP session by disposing any allocated
       subscriptions/registrations for that particular client and
       without waiting for or processing any messages subsequently
       received from the peer,

   3.  SHOULD also drop the WAMP connection at transport level
       (recommended to prevent denial of service attacks)

6.  Messages

   All WAMP messages are a "list" with a first element "MessageType"
   followed by one or more message type specific elements:

       [MessageType|integer, ... one or more message type specific
           elements ...]

   The notation "Element|type" denotes a message element named "Element"
   of type "type", where "type" is one of

   o  "uri": a string URI as defined in Section 5.1.1

   o  "id": an integer ID as defined in Section 5.1.2

   o  "integer": a non-negative integer

   o  "string": a Unicode string, including the empty string

   o  "bool": a boolean value ("true" or "false") - integers MUST NOT be
      used instead of boolean value

   o  "dict": a dictionary (map) where keys MUST be strings, keys MUST
      be unique and serialization order is undefined (left to the
      serializer being used)

   o  "list": a list (array) where items can be again any of this
      enumeration

   _Example_

   A "SUBSCRIBE" message has the following format

       [SUBSCRIBE, Request|id, Options|dict, Topic|uri]

   Here is an example message conforming to the above format

       [32, 713845233, {}, "com.myapp.mytopic1"]

6.1.  Extensibility

   Some WAMP messages contain "Options|dict" or "Details|dict" elements.
   This allows for future extensibility and implementations that only
   provide subsets of functionality by ignoring unimplemented
   attributes.  Keys in "Options" and "Details" MUST be of type "string"
   and MUST match the regular expression "[a-z][a-z0-9_]{2,}" for WAMP
   predefined keys.  Implementations MAY use implementation-specific




Oberstein & Goedde      Expires October 20, 2018               [Page 22]

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   keys that MUST match the regular expression "_[a-z0-9_]{3,}".
   Attributes unknown to an implementation MUST be ignored.

6.2.  No Polymorphism

   For a given "MessageType" and number of message elements the expected
   types are uniquely defined.  Hence there are no polymorphic messages
   in WAMP.  This leads to a message parsing and validation control flow
   that is efficient, simple to implement and simple to code for
   rigorous message format checking.

6.3.  Structure

   The application payload (that is call arguments, call results, event
   payload etc) is always at the end of the message element list.  The
   rationale is: Brokers and Dealers have no need to inspect (parse) the
   application payload.  Their business is call/event routing.  Having
   the application payload at the end of the list allows Brokers and
   Dealers to skip parsing it altogether.  This can improve efficiency
   and performance.

6.4.  Message Definitions

   WAMP defines the following messages that are explained in detail in
   the following sections.

   The messages concerning the WAMP session itself are mandatory for all
   Peers, i.e. a Client MUST implement "HELLO", "ABORT" and "GOODBYE",
   while a Router MUST implement "WELCOME", "ABORT" and "GOODBYE".

   All other messages are mandatory per role, i.e. in an implementation
   that only provides a Client with the role of Publisher MUST
   additionally implement sending "PUBLISH" and receiving "PUBLISHED"
   and "ERROR" messages.

6.4.1.  Session Lifecycle

6.4.1.1.  HELLO

6.6.  Extension Messages

   WAMP uses type codes from the core range [0, 255].  Implementations
   MAY define and use implementation specific messages with message type
   codes from the extension message range [256, 1023].  For example, a

   router MAY implement router-to-router communication by using
   extension messages.

6.7.  Empty Arguments and Keyword Arguments

   Implementations SHOULD avoid sending empty "Arguments" lists.

   E.g. a "CALL" message

       [CALL, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri,
           Arguments|list]

   where "Arguments == []" SHOULD be avoided, and instead

       [CALL, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri]

   SHOULD be sent.

   Implementations SHOULD avoid sending empty "ArgumentsKw"
   dictionaries.

   E.g. a "CALL" message

       [CALL, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri,
           Arguments|list, ArgumentsKw|dict]

   where "ArgumentsKw == {}" SHOULD be avoided, and instead

       [CALL, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri,
           Arguments|list]

   SHOULD be sent when "Arguments" is non-empty.

7.  Sessions

   The message flow between Clients and Routers for opening and closing
   WAMP sessions involves the following messages:

   1.  "HELLO"

   2.  "WELCOME"

   3.  "ABORT"

   4.  "GOODBYE"

7.1.  Session Establishment

7.1.1.  HELLO

   After the underlying transport has been established, the opening of a
   WAMP session is initiated by the Client sending a "HELLO" message to
   the Router

       [HELLO, Realm|uri, Details|dict]

   where

   o  "Realm" is a string identifying the realm this session should
      attach to

   o  "Details" is a dictionary that allows to provide additional
      opening information (see below).

   The "HELLO" message MUST be the very first message sent by the Client
   after the transport has been established.

   In the WAMP Basic Profile without session authentication the Router
   will reply with a "WELCOME" or "ABORT" message.

       ,------.          ,------.
       |Client|          |Router|
       `--+---'          `--+---'
          |      HELLO      |
          | ---------------->
          |                 |
          |     WELCOME     |
          | <----------------
       ,--+---.          ,--+---.
       |Client|          |Router|
       `------'          `------'

   A WAMP session starts its lifetime when the Router has sent a
   "WELCOME" message to the Client, and ends when the underlying
   transport closes or when the session is closed explicitly by either
   peer sending the "GOODBYE" message (see below).

   It is a Section 5.3.3 to receive a second "HELLO" message during the
   lifetime of the session and the Peer MUST close the session if that
   happens.

7.1.1.1.  Client: Role and Feature Announcement

   WAMP uses _Role & Feature announcement_ instead of _protocol
   versioning_ to allow

   o  implementations only supporting subsets of functionality

   o  future extensibility

   A Client must announce the roles it supports via
   "Hello.Details.roles|dict", with a key mapping to a
   "Hello.Details.roles.<role>|dict" where "<role>" can be:

   o  "publisher"

   o  "subscriber"

   o  "caller"

   o  "callee"

   A Client can support any combination of the above roles but must
   support at least one role.

   The "<role>|dict" is a dictionary describing features supported by
   the peer for that role.

   This MUST be empty for WAMP Basic Profile implementations, and MUST
   be used by implementations implementing parts of the Advanced Profile
   to list the specific set of features they support.

   _Example: A Client that implements the Publisher and Subscriber roles
   of the WAMP Basic Profile._

       [1, "somerealm", {
         "roles": {
             "publisher": {},
             "subscriber": {}
         }
       }]

7.1.2.  WELCOME

   A Router completes the opening of a WAMP session by sending a
   "WELCOME" reply message to the Client.

       [WELCOME, Session|id, Details|dict]




Oberstein & Goedde      Expires October 20, 2018               [Page 31]

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   where

   o  "Session" MUST be a randomly generated ID specific to the WAMP
      session.  This applies for the lifetime of the session.

   o  "Details" is a dictionary that allows to provide additional
      information regarding the open session (see below).

   In the WAMP Basic Profile without session authentication, a "WELCOME"
   message MUST be the first message sent by the Router, directly in
   response to a "HELLO" message received from the Client.  Extensions
   in the Advanced Profile MAY include intermediate steps and messages
   for authentication.

      Note.  The behavior if a requested "Realm" does not presently
      exist is router-specific.  A router may e.g. automatically create
      the realm, or deny the establishment of the session with a "ABORT"
      reply message.

7.1.2.1.  Router: Role and Feature Announcement

   Similar to a Client announcing Roles and Features supported in the
   `"HELLO" message, a Router announces its supported Roles and Features
   in the "WELCOME" message.

   A Router MUST announce the roles it supports via
   "Welcome.Details.roles|dict", with a key mapping to a
   "Welcome.Details.roles.<role>|dict" where "<role>" can be:

   o  "broker"

   o  "dealer"

   A Router must support at least one role, and MAY support both roles.

   The "<role>|dict" is a dictionary describing features supported by
   the peer for that role.  With WAMP Basic Profile implementations,
   this MUST be empty, but MUST be used by implementations implementing
   parts of the Advanced Profile to list the specific set of features
   they support

   _Example: A Router implementing the Broker role of the WAMP Basic
   Profile._

       [2, 9129137332, {
          "roles": {
             "broker": {}
          }
       }]

7.1.3.  ABORT

   Both the Router and the Client may abort a WAMP session by sending an
   "ABORT" message.

       [ABORT, Details|dict, Reason|uri]

   where

   o  "Reason" MUST be an URI.

   o  "Details" MUST be a dictionary that allows to provide additional,
      optional closing information (see below).

   No response to an "ABORT" message is expected.

   There are few scenarios, when "ABORT" is used:

   o  During session opening, if peer decided to abort connect.

       ,------.          ,------.
       |Client|          |Router|
       `--+---'          `--+---'
          |      HELLO      |
          | ---------------->
          |                 |
          |      ABORT      |
          | <----------------
       ,--+---.          ,--+---.
       |Client|          |Router|
       `------'          `------'

   _Example_

       [3, {"message": "The realm does not exist."},
           "wamp.error.no_such_realm"]

   o  After session is opened, when protocol violation happens (see
      "Protocol errors" section).

   _Examples_

   o  Router received second HELLO message.

       [3, {"message":
               "Received HELLO message after session was established."},
           "wamp.error.protocol_violation"]

   o  Client peer received second WELCOME message

     [3, {"message":
             "Received WELCOME message after session was established."},
         "wamp.error.protocol_violation"]

7.2.  Session Closing

   A WAMP session starts its lifetime with the Router sending a
   "WELCOME" message to the Client and ends when the underlying
   transport disappears or when the WAMP session is closed explicitly by
   a "GOODBYE" message sent by one Peer and a "GOODBYE" message sent
   from the other Peer in response.

       [GOODBYE, Details|dict, Reason|uri]

   where

   o  "Reason" MUST be an URI.

   o  "Details" MUST be a dictionary that allows to provide additional,
      optional closing information (see below).

       ,------.          ,------.
       |Client|          |Router|
       `--+---'          `--+---'
          |     GOODBYE     |
          | ---------------->
          |                 |
          |     GOODBYE     |
          | <----------------
       ,--+---.          ,--+---.
       |Client|          |Router|
       `------'          `------'

   _Example_. One Peer initiates closing

       [6, {"message": "The host is shutting down now."},
           "wamp.close.system_shutdown"]

   and the other peer replies

       [6, {}, "wamp.close.goodbye_and_out"]

   _Example_. One Peer initiates closing

       [6, {}, "wamp.close.close_realm"]

   and the other peer replies

       [6, {}, "wamp.close.goodbye_and_out"]

7.2.1.  Difference between ABORT and GOODBYE

   The differences between "ABORT" and "GOODBYE" messages is
   that "ABORT" is never replied to by a Peer, whereas "GOODBYE" must be
   replied to by the receiving Peer.

      Though "ABORT" and "GOODBYE" are structurally identical, using
      different message types serves to reduce overloaded meaning of
      messages and simplify message handling code.

7.2.2.  Session Statechart

   The following state chart gives the states that a WAMP peer can be in
   during the session lifetime cycle.

8.  Agent Identification

   When a software agent operates in a network protocol, it often
   identifies itself, its application type, operating system, software
   vendor, or software revision, by submitting a characteristic
   identification string to its operating peer.

   Similar to what browsers do with the "User-Agent" HTTP header, both
   the "HELLO" and the "WELCOME" message MAY disclose the WAMP
   implementation in use to its peer:

       HELLO.Details.agent|string

   and

       WELCOME.Details.agent|string

   _Example: A Client "HELLO" message._

       [1, "somerealm", {
            "agent": "AutobahnJS-0.9.14",
            "roles": {
               "subscriber": {},
               "publisher": {}
            }
       }]

   _Example: A Router "WELCOME" message._

9.  Publish and Subscribe

   All of the following features for Publish & Subscribe are mandatory

9.1.  Subscribing and Unsubscribing

   The message flow between Clients implementing the role of Subscriber
   and Routers implementing the role of Broker for subscribing and
   unsubscribing involves the following messages:

   1.  "SUBSCRIBE"

   2.  "SUBSCRIBED"

   3.  "UNSUBSCRIBE"

   4.  "UNSUBSCRIBED"

   5.  "ERROR"

   A Subscriber may subscribe to zero, one or more topics, and a
   Publisher publishes to topics without knowledge of subscribers.

   Upon subscribing to a topic via the "SUBSCRIBE" message, a Subscriber
   will receive any future events published to the respective topic by
   Publishers, and will receive those events asynchronously.

   A subscription lasts for the duration of a session, unless a
   Subscriber opts out from a previously established subscription via
   the "UNSUBSCRIBE" message.

      A Subscriber may have more than one event handler attached to the
      same subscription.  This can be implemented in different ways: a)
      a Subscriber can recognize itself that it is already subscribed
      and just attach another handler to the subscription for incoming
      events, b) or it can send a new "SUBSCRIBE" message to broker (as
      it would be first) and upon receiving a
      "SUBSCRIBED.Subscription|id" it already knows about, attach the
      handler to the existing subscription

9.1.1.  SUBSCRIBE

   A Subscriber communicates its interest in a topic to a Broker by
   sending a "SUBSCRIBE" message:

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


       [SUBSCRIBE, Request|id, Options|dict, Topic|uri]

   where

   o  "Request" MUST be a random, ephemeral ID chosen by the Subscriber
      and used to correlate the Broker's response with the request.

   o  "Options" MUST be a dictionary that allows to provide additional
      subscription request details in a extensible way.  This is
      described further below.

   o  "Topic" is the topic the Subscriber wants to subscribe to and MUST
      be an URI.

   _Example_

       [32, 713845233, {}, "com.myapp.mytopic1"]

   A Broker, receiving a "SUBSCRIBE" message, can fullfill or reject the
   subscription, so it answers with "SUBSCRIBED" or "ERROR" messages.

9.1.2.  SUBSCRIBED

   If the Broker is able to fulfill and allow the subscription, it
   answers by sending a "SUBSCRIBED" message to the Subscriber

       [SUBSCRIBED, SUBSCRIBE.Request|id, Subscription|id]

   where

   o  "SUBSCRIBE.Request" MUST be the ID from the original request.

   o  "Subscription" MUST be an ID chosen by the Broker for the
      subscription.

   _Example_

       [33, 713845233, 5512315355]

      Note.  The "Subscription" ID chosen by the broker need not be
      unique to the subscription of a single Subscriber, but may be
      assigned to the "Topic", or the combination of the "Topic" and
      some or all "Options", such as the topic pattern matching method
      to be used.  Then this ID may be sent to all Subscribers for the
      "Topic" or "Topic" / "Options" combination.  This allows the
      Broker to serialize an event to be delivered only once for all
      actual receivers of the event.

      In case of receiving a "SUBSCRIBE" message from the same
      Subscriber and to already subscribed topic, Broker should answer
      with "SUBSCRIBED" message, containing the existing
      "Subscription|id".

9.1.3.  Subscribe ERROR

   When the request for subscription cannot be fulfilled by the Broker,
   the Broker sends back an "ERROR" message to the Subscriber

       [ERROR, SUBSCRIBE, SUBSCRIBE.Request|id, Details|dict,
           Error|uri]

   where

   o  "SUBSCRIBE.Request" MUST be the ID from the original request.

   o  "Error" MUST be an URI that gives the error of why the request
      could not be fulfilled.

   _Example_

       [8, 32, 713845233, {}, "wamp.error.not_authorized"]

9.1.4.  UNSUBSCRIBE

   When a Subscriber is no longer interested in receiving events for a
   subscription it sends an "UNSUBSCRIBE" message

       [UNSUBSCRIBE, Request|id, SUBSCRIBED.Subscription|id]

   where

   o  "Request" MUST be a random, ephemeral ID chosen by the Subscriber
      and used to correlate the Broker's response with the request.

   o  "SUBSCRIBED.Subscription" MUST be the ID for the subscription to
      unsubscribe from, originally handed out by the Broker to the
      Subscriber.

   _Example_

9.1.5.  UNSUBSCRIBED

   Upon successful unsubscription, the Broker sends an "UNSUBSCRIBED"
   message to the Subscriber

       [UNSUBSCRIBED, UNSUBSCRIBE.Request|id]

   where

   o  "UNSUBSCRIBE.Request" MUST be the ID from the original request.

   _Example_

       [35, 85346237]

9.1.6.  Unsubscribe ERROR

   When the request fails, the Broker sends an "ERROR"

       [ERROR, UNSUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE.Request|id, Details|dict,
           Error|uri]

   where

   o  "UNSUBSCRIBE.Request" MUST be the ID from the original request.

   o  "Error" MUST be an URI that gives the error of why the request
      could not be fulfilled.

   _Example_

       [8, 34, 85346237, {}, "wamp.error.no_such_subscription"]

9.2.1.  PUBLISH

   When a Publisher requests to publish an event to some topic, it sends
   a "PUBLISH" message to a Broker:

       [PUBLISH, Request|id, Options|dict, Topic|uri]

   or

       [PUBLISH, Request|id, Options|dict, Topic|uri, Arguments|list]

   or

       [PUBLISH, Request|id, Options|dict, Topic|uri, Arguments|list,
           ArgumentsKw|dict]

   where

   o  "Request" is a random, ephemeral ID chosen by the Publisher and
      used to correlate the Broker's response with the request.

   o  "Options" is a dictionary that allows to provide additional
      publication request details in an extensible way.  This is
      described further below.

   o  "Topic" is the topic published to.

   o  "Arguments" is a list of application-level event payload elements.
      The list may be of zero length.

   o  "ArgumentsKw" is an optional dictionary containing application-
      level event payload, provided as keyword arguments.  The
      dictionary may be empty.

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   If the Broker allows and is able to fulfill the publication, the
   Broker will send the event to all current Subscribers of the topic of
   the published event.

   By default, publications are unacknowledged, and the Broker will not
   respond, whether the publication was successful indeed or not.  This
   behavior can be changed with the option
   "PUBLISH.Options.acknowledge|bool" (see below).

   _Example_

       [16, 239714735, {}, "com.myapp.mytopic1"]

   _Example_

       [16, 239714735, {}, "com.myapp.mytopic1", ["Hello, world!"]]

   _Example_

       [16, 239714735, {}, "com.myapp.mytopic1", [], {"color": "orange",
           "sizes": [23, 42, 7]}]

9.2.2.  PUBLISHED

   If the Broker is able to fulfill and allowing the publication, and
   "PUBLISH.Options.acknowledge == true", the Broker replies by sending
   a "PUBLISHED" message to the Publisher:

       [PUBLISHED, PUBLISH.Request|id, Publication|id]

   where

   o  "PUBLISH.Request" is the ID from the original publication request.

   o  "Publication" is a ID chosen by the Broker for the publication.

   _Example_

       [17, 239714735, 4429313566]

9.2.3.  Publish ERROR

   When the request for publication cannot be fulfilled by the Broker,
   and "PUBLISH.Options.acknowledge == true", the Broker sends back an
   "ERROR" message to the Publisher

       [ERROR, PUBLISH, PUBLISH.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri]

   where

   o  "PUBLISH.Request" is the ID from the original publication request.

   o  "Error" is an URI that gives the error of why the request could
      not be fulfilled.

   _Example_

       [8, 16, 239714735, {}, "wamp.error.not_authorized"]

9.2.4.  EVENT

   When a publication is successful and a Broker dispatches the event,
   it determines a list of receivers for the event based on Subscribers
   for the topic published to and, possibly, other information in the
   event.

   Note that the Publisher of an event will never receive the published
   event even if the Publisher is also a Subscriber of the topic
   published to.

      The Advanced Profile provides options for more detailed control
      over publication.

   When a Subscriber is deemed to be a receiver, the Broker sends the
   Subscriber an "EVENT" message:

       [EVENT, SUBSCRIBED.Subscription|id, PUBLISHED.Publication|id,
           Details|dict]

   or

       [EVENT, SUBSCRIBED.Subscription|id, PUBLISHED.Publication|id,
           Details|dict, PUBLISH.Arguments|list]

   or

       [EVENT, SUBSCRIBED.Subscription|id, PUBLISHED.Publication|id,
       Details|dict, PUBLISH.Arguments|list, PUBLISH.ArgumentKw|dict]

   where

   o  "SUBSCRIBED.Subscription" is the ID for the subscription under
      which the Subscriber receives the event - the ID for the
      subscription originally handed out by the Broker to the
      Subscribe*.

   o  "PUBLISHED.Publication" is the ID of the publication of the
      published event.

   o  "Details" is a dictionary that allows the Broker to provide
      additional event details in a extensible way.  This is described
      further below.

   o  "PUBLISH.Arguments" is the application-level event payload that
      was provided with the original publication request.

   o  "PUBLISH.ArgumentKw" is the application-level event payload that
      was provided with the original publication request.

   _Example_

       [36, 5512315355, 4429313566, {}]

   _Example_

       [36, 5512315355, 4429313566, {}, ["Hello, world!"]]

   _Example_

10.1.1.  REGISTER

   A Callee announces the availability of an endpoint implementing a
   procedure with a Dealer by sending a "REGISTER" message:

       [REGISTER, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri]

   where

   o  "Request" is a random, ephemeral ID chosen by the Callee and used
      to correlate the Dealer's response with the request.

   o  "Options" is a dictionary that allows to provide additional
      registration request details in a extensible way.  This is
      described further below.

   The execution of remote procedure calls is asynchronous, and there
   may be more than one call outstanding.  A call is called outstanding
   (from the point of view of the Caller), when a (final) result or
   error has not yet been received by the Caller.

10.2.1.  CALL

   When a Caller wishes to call a remote procedure, it sends a "CALL"
   message to a Dealer:

   o  "Options" is a dictionary that allows to provide additional call
      request details in an extensible way.  This is described further
      below.

   o  "Procedure" is the URI of the procedure to be called.

10.2.2.  INVOCATION

   If the Dealer is able to fulfill (mediate) the call and it allows the
   call, it sends a "INVOCATION" message to the respective Callee
   implementing the procedure:

       [INVOCATION, Request|id, REGISTERED.Registration|id,

           "surname": "Doe"}]

10.2.3.  YIELD

   If the Callee is able to successfully process and finish the
   execution of the call, it answers by sending a "YIELD" message to the
   Dealer:

11.  Predefined URIs

   WAMP pre-defines the following error URIs for the basic and for the
   advanced profile.  WAMP peers MUST use only the defined error
   messages.

11.1.  Basic Profile

11.1.1.  Incorrect URIs

   When a Peer provides an incorrect URI for any URI-based attribute of
   a WAMP message (e.g. realm, topic), then the other Peer MUST respond
   with an "ERROR" message and give the following _Error URI_:

       wamp.error.invalid_uri

11.1.2.  Interaction

   Peer provided an incorrect URI for any URI-based attribute of WAMP
   message, such as realm, topic or procedure

       wamp.error.invalid_uri

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   A Dealer could not perform a call, since no procedure is currently
   registered under the given URI.

       wamp.error.no_such_procedure

   A procedure could not be registered, since a procedure with the given
   URI is already registered.

       wamp.error.procedure_already_exists

   A Dealer could not perform an unregister, since the given
   registration is not active.

       wamp.error.no_such_registration

   A Broker could not perform an unsubscribe, since the given
   subscription is not active.

       wamp.error.no_such_subscription

   A call failed since the given argument types or values are not
   acceptable to the called procedure.  In this case the Callee may
   throw this error.  Alternatively a Router may throw this error if it
   performed _payload validation_ of a call, call result, call error or
   publish, and the payload did not conform to the requirements.

       wamp.error.invalid_argument

11.1.3.  Session Close

   The Peer is shutting down completely - used as a "GOODBYE" (or
   "ABORT") reason.

       wamp.close.system_shutdown

   The Peer want to leave the realm - used as a "GOODBYE" reason.

       wamp.close.close_realm

   A Peer acknowledges ending of a session - used as a "GOODBYE" reply
   reason.

       wamp.close.goodbye_and_out

   A Peer received invalid WAMP protocol message (e.g.  "HELLO" message
   after session was already established) - used as a "ABORT" reply
   reason.

       wamp.error.protocol_violation

11.1.4.  Authorization

   A join, call, register, publish or subscribe failed, since the Peer
   is not authorized to perform the operation.

       wamp.error.not_authorized

   A Dealer or Broker could not determine if the Peer is authorized to
   perform a join, call, register, publish or subscribe, since the
   authorization operation _itself_ failed.  E.g. a custom authorizer
   did run into an error.

       wamp.error.authorization_failed

   Peer wanted to join a non-existing realm (and the Router did not
   allow to auto-create the realm).

       wamp.error.no_such_realm

   A Peer was to be authenticated under a Role that does not (or no
   longer) exists on the Router.  For example, the Peer was successfully
   authenticated, but the Role configured does not exists - hence there
   is some misconfiguration in the Router.

       wamp.error.no_such_role

11.2.  Advanced Profile

   A _Dealer_ or _Callee_ canceled a call previously issued

       wamp.error.canceled

   A _Peer_ requested an interaction with an option that was disallowed
   by the _Router_

       wamp.error.option_not_allowed

   A _Dealer_ could not perform a call, since a procedure with the given
   URI is registered, but _Callee Black- and Whitelisting_ and/or
   _Caller Exclusion_ lead to the exclusion of (any) _Callee_ providing
   the procedure.

       wamp.error.no_eligible_callee

   A _Router_ rejected client request to disclose its identity

   A _Router_ encountered a network failure

       wamp.error.network_failure

12.  Ordering Guarantees

   All WAMP implementations, in particular Routers MUST support the
   following ordering guarantees.

      A WAMP Advanced Profile may provide applications options to relax
      ordering guarantees, in particular with distributed calls.

12.1.  Publish & Subscribe Ordering

   Regarding *Publish & Subscribe*, the ordering guarantees are as
   follows:

   If _Subscriber A_ is subscribed to both *Topic 1* and *Topic 2*, and
   _Publisher B_ first publishes an *Event 1* to *Topic 1* and then an
   *Event 2* to *Topic 2*, then _Subscriber A_ will first receive *Event
   1* and then *Event 2*. This also holds if *Topic 1* and *Topic 2* are
   identical.

   In other words, WAMP guarantees ordering of events between any given
   _pair_ of Publisher and Subscriber.

   Further, if _Subscriber A_ subscribes to *Topic 1*, the "SUBSCRIBED"
   message will be sent by the _Broker_ to _Subscriber A_ before any
   "EVENT" message for *Topic 1*.

   There is no guarantee regarding the order of return for multiple
   subsequent subscribe requests.  A subscribe request might require the
   _Broker_ to do a time-consuming lookup in some database, whereas
   another subscribe request second might be permissible immediately.

12.2.  Remote Procedure Call Ordering

   Regarding *Remote Procedure Calls*, the ordering guarantees are as
   follows:

   If _Callee A_ has registered endpoints for both *Procedure 1* and
   *Procedure 2*, and _Caller B_ first issues a *Call 1* to *Procedure
   1* and then a *Call 2* to *Procedure 2*, and both calls are routed to
   _Callee A_, then _Callee A_ will first receive an invocation
   corresponding to *Call 1* and then *Call 2*. This also holds if
   *Procedure 1* and *Procedure 2* are identical.

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   In other words, WAMP guarantees ordering of invocations between any
   given _pair_ of Caller and Callee.

   There are no guarantees on the order of call results and errors in
   relation to _different_ calls, since the execution of calls upon
   different invocations of endpoints in Callees are running
   independently.  A first call might require an expensive, long-running
   computation, whereas a second, subsequent call might finish
   immediately.

   Further, if _Callee A_ registers for *Procedure 1*, the "REGISTERED"
   message will be sent by _Dealer_ to _Callee A_ before any
   "INVOCATION" message for *Procedure 1*.

   There is no guarantee regarding the order of return for multiple
   subsequent register requests.  A register request might require the
   _Broker_ to do a time-consuming lookup in some database, whereas
   another register request second might be permissible immediately.

13.  Security Model

   The following discusses the security model for the Basic Profile.
   Any changes or extensions to this for the Advanced Profile are
   discussed further on as part of the Advanced Profile definition.

13.1.  Transport Encryption and Integrity

   WAMP transports may provide (optional) transport-level encryption and
   integrity verification.  If so, encryption and integrity is point-to-
   point: between a Client and the Router it is connected to.

   Transport-level encryption and integrity is solely at the transport-
   level and transparent to WAMP.  WAMP itself deliberately does not
   specify any kind of transport-level encryption.

   Implementations that offer TCP based transport such as WAMP-over-
   WebSocket or WAMP-over-RawSocket SHOULD implement Transport Layer
   Security (TLS).

   WAMP deployments are encouraged to stick to a TLS-only policy with
   the TLS code and setup being hardened.

   Further, when a Client connects to a Router over a local-only
   transport such as Unix domain sockets, the integrity of the data
   transmitted is implicit (the OS kernel is trusted), and the privacy
   of the data transmitted can be assured using file system permissions
   (no one can tap a Unix domain socket without appropriate permissions
   or being root).

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


13.2.  Router Authentication

   To authenticate Routers to Clients, deployments MUST run TLS and
   Clients MUST verify the Router server certificate presented.  WAMP
   itself does not provide mechanisms to authenticate a Router (only a
   Client).

   The verification of the Router server certificate can happen

   1.  against a certificate trust database that comes with the Clients
       operating system

   2.  against an issuing certificate/key hard-wired into the Client

   3.  by using new mechanisms like DNS-based Authentication of Named
       Enitities (DNSSEC)/TLSA

   Further, when a Client connects to a Router over a local-only
   transport such as Unix domain sockets, the file system permissions
   can be used to create implicit trust.  E.g. if only the OS user under
   which the Router runs has the permission to create a Unix domain
   socket under a specific path, Clients connecting to that path can
   trust in the router authenticity.

13.3.  Client Authentication

   Authentication of a Client to a Router at the WAMP level is not part
   of the basic profile.

   When running over TLS, a Router MAY authenticate a Client at the
   transport level by doing a _client certificate based authentication_.

13.3.1.  Routers are trusted

   Routers are _trusted_ by Clients.

   In particular, Routers can read (and modify) any application payload
   transmitted in events, calls, call results and call errors (the
   "Arguments" or "ArgumentsKw" message fields).

   Hence, Routers do not provide confidentiality with respect to
   application payload, and also do not provide authenticity or
   integrity of application payloads that could be verified by a
   receiving Client.

   Routers need to read the application payloads in cases of automatic
   conversion between different serialization formats.

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   Further, Routers are trusted to *actually perform* routing as
   specified.  E.g. a Client that publishes an event has to trust a
   Router that the event is actually dispatched to all (eligible)
   Subscribers by the Router.

   A rogue Router might deny normal routing operation without a Client
   taking notice.

14.  Advanced Profile

   While implementations MUST implement the subset of the Basic Profile
   necessary for the particular set of WAMP roles they provide, they MAY
   implement any subset of features from the Advanced Profile.
   Implementers SHOULD implement the maximum of features possible
   considering the aims of an implementation.

      Note: Features listed here may be experimental or underspecced and
      yet unimplemented in any implementation.  This part of the
      specification is very much a work in progress.  An approximate
      status of each feature is given at the beginning of the feature
      section.

14.1.  Messages

   The Advanced Profile defines the following additional messages which
   are explained in detail in separate sections.

14.1.1.  Message Definitions

   The following 4 additional message types MAY be used in the Advanced
   Profile.

14.1.1.1.  CHALLENGE

   The "CHALLENGE" message is used with certain Authentication Methods.
   During authenticated session establishment, a *Router* sends a
   challenge message.

       [CHALLENGE, AuthMethod|string, Extra|dict]

14.1.1.2.  AUTHENTICATE

   The "AUTHENTICATE" message is used with certain Authentication
   Methods.  A *Client* having received a challenge is expected to
   respond by sending a signature or token.

       [AUTHENTICATE, Signature|string, Extra|dict]

14.1.1.3.  CANCEL

   The "CANCEL" message is used with the Call Canceling advanced
   feature.  A _Caller_ can cancel and issued call actively by sending a
   cancel message to the _Dealer_.

       [CANCEL, CALL.Request|id, Options|dict]

14.1.1.4.  INTERRUPT

   The "INTERRUPT" message is used with the Call Canceling advanced
   feature.  Upon receiving a cancel for a pending call, a _Dealer_ will
   issue an interrupt to the _Callee_.

       [INTERRUPT, INVOCATION.Request|id, Options|dict]

14.1.2.  Message Codes and Direction

   The following table list the message type code for *the OPTIONAL
   messages* defined in this part of the document and their direction
   between peer roles.

   +-----+----------------+-----+-----+------+------+-------+--------+
   | Cod |    Message     | Pub | Brk | Subs | Calr | Dealr | Callee |
   +-----+----------------+-----+-----+------+------+-------+--------+
   |  4  |  "CHALLENGE"   |  Rx |  Tx |  Rx  |  Rx  |   Tx  |   Rx   |
   |  5  | "AUTHENTICATE" |  Tx |  Rx |  Tx  |  Tx  |   Rx  |   Tx   |
   |  49 |    "CANCEL"    |     |     |      |  Tx  |   Rx  |        |
   |  69 |  "INTERRUPT"   |     |     |      |      |   Tx  |   Rx   |
   +-----+----------------+-----+-----+------+------+-------+--------+

      "Tx" ("Rx") means the message is sent (received) by a peer of the
      respective role.

14.2.  Features

   Support for advanced features must be announced by the peers which
   implement them.  The following is a complete list of advanced
   features currently defined or proposed.

14.3.1.  Progressive Call Results

14.3.1.1.  Feature Definition

   A procedure implemented by a _Callee_ and registered at a _Dealer_
   may produce progressive results.  Progressive results can e.g. be
   used to return partial results for long-running operations, or to
   chunk the transmission of larger results sets.

   The message flow for progressive results involves:

   If the _Callee_ supports progressive calls, the _Dealer_ will forward
   the _Caller's_ willingness to receive progressive results by setting

       ]

   Upon receiving an "YIELD" message from a _Callee_ with
   "YIELD.Options.progress == true" (for a call that is still ongoing),
   the _Dealer_ will *immediately* send a "RESULT" message to the
   original _Caller_ with

       ]

   and so on...

   An invocation MUST _always_ end in either a _normal_ "RESULT" or
   "ERROR" message being sent by the _Callee_ and received by the
   _Dealer_.

       ]

   In other words: "YIELD" with "YIELD.Options.progress == true" and
   "RESULT" with "RESULT.Details.progress == true" messages may only be
   sent _during_ a call or invocation is still ongoing.

   The final "YIELD" and final "RESULT" may also be empty, e.g. when all
   actual results have already been transmitted in progressive result
   messages.

   The progressive "YIELD" and progressive "RESULT" may also be empty,
   e.g. when those messages are only used to signal that the procedure
   is still running and working, and the actual result is completely
   delivered in the final "YIELD" and "RESULT":

   _Example._ Callee-to-Dealer "YIELDs"

       [70, 87683, {"progress": true}]

      Note that intermediate, progressive results and/or the final
      result MAY have different structure.  The WAMP peer implementation
      is responsible for mapping everything into a form suitable for
      consumption in the host language.

   Even if a _Caller_ has indicated its expectation to receive
   progressive results by setting "CALL.Options.receive_progress|bool :=
   true", a _Callee_ is *not required* to produce progressive results.
   "CALL.Options.receive_progress" and
   "INVOCATION.Details.receive_progress" are simply indications that the
   _Caller_ is prepared to process progressive results, should there be
   any produced.  In other words, _Callees_ are free to ignore such
   "receive_progress" hints at any time.

14.3.1.2.  Progressive Call Result Cancellation

   Upon receiving a "YIELD" message from a _Callee_ with
   "YIELD.Options.progress == true" (for a call that is still ongoing),
   if the original _Caller_ is no longer available (has left the realm),
   then the _Dealer_ will send an "INTERRUPT" to the _Callee_.  The
   "INTERRUPT" will have "Options.mode" set to ""killnowait"" to
   indicate to the client that no response should be sent to the
   "INTERRUPT".  This "INTERRUPT" in only sent in response to a
   progressive "YIELD" ("Details.progress == true"), and is not sent in
   response to a normal or final "YIELD".

             [INTERRUPT, INVOCATION.Request|id, Options|dict]

   Options:

               INTERRUPT.Options.mode|string == "killnowait"

   Progressive call result cancellation closes an important safety gap:
   In cases where progressive results are used to stream data to
   _Callers_, and network connectivity is unreliable, _Callers_ my often
   get disconnected in the middle of receiving progressive results.
   Recurring connect, call, disconnect cycles can quickly build up
   _Callees_ streaming results to dead _Callers_. This can overload the
   router and further degrade network connectivity.

   The message flow for progressive results cancellation involves:

   Note: Any "ERROR" returned by the _Callee_, in response to the
   "INTERRUPT", is ignored (same as in call canceling when
   mode="killnowait").  So, it is not necessary for the _Callee_ to send
   an "ERROR" message.

14.3.1.3.  Callee

   A _Callee_ that does not support progressive results SHOULD ignore
   any "INVOCATION.Details.receive_progress" flag.

   A _Callee_ that supports progressive results, but does not support
   call canceling is considered by the _Dealer_ to not support
   progressive results.

14.3.1.4.  Feature Announcement

   Support for this advanced feature MUST be announced by _Callers_
   ("role := "caller""), _Callees_ ("role := "callee"") and _Dealers_
   ("role := "dealer"") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.

   Additionally, _Callees_ and _Dealers_ MUST support Call Canceling,
   which is required for canceling progressive results if the original
   _Caller_ leaves the realm.  If a _Callee_ supports Progressive Call
   Results, but not Call Canceling, then the _Dealer_ disregards the
   _Callees_ Progressive Call Results feature.

14.3.2.  Progressive Calls

14.3.2.1.  Feature Definition

   A procedure implemented by a _Callee_ and registered at a _Dealer_
   may receive a progressive call.  Progressive results can e.g. be used
   to start processing initial data where a larger data set may not yet
   have been generated or received by the _Caller_.

   See this GitHub issue for more discussion: <https://github.com/wamp-
   proto/wamp-proto/issues/167>

14.3.3.  Call Timeouts

14.3.3.1.  Feature Definition

   A _Caller_ might want to issue a call and provide a _timeout_ after
   which the call will finish.

   A _timeout_ allows for *automatic* cancellation of a call after a
   specified time either at the _Callee_ or at the _Dealer_.

   A _Caller_ specifies a timeout by providing

       CALL.Options.timeout|integer

   in ms.  A timeout value of "0" deactivates automatic call timeout.
   This is also the default value.

   The timeout option is a companion to, but slightly different from the
   "CANCEL" and "INTERRUPT" messages that allow a _Caller_ and _Dealer_
   to *actively* cancel a call or invocation.

   In fact, a timeout timer might run at three places:

   o  _Caller_

   o  _Dealer_

   o  _Callee_

14.3.3.2.  Feature Announcement

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Callers_ ("role :=
   "caller""), _Callees_ ("role := "callee"") and _Dealers_ ("role :=
   "dealer"") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.call_timeout|bool := true

14.3.4.  Call Canceling

14.3.4.1.  Feature Definition

   A _Caller_ might want to actively cancel a call that was issued, but
   not has yet returned.  An example where this is useful could be a
   user triggering a long running operation and later changing his mind
   or no longer willing to wait.

   The message flow between _Callers_, a _Dealer_ and _Callees_ for
   canceling remote procedure calls involves the following messages:

   o  "CANCEL"

   o  "INTERRUPT"

   o  "ERROR"

   A call may be canceled at the _Callee_ or at the _Dealer_ side.
   Cancellation behaves differently depending on the mode:

   o  *skip*: The pending call is canceled and "ERROR" is sent
      immediately back to the caller.  No "INTERRUPT" is sent to the
      callee and the result is discarded when received.

   o  *kill*: "INTERRUPT" is sent to the callee, but "ERROR" is not
      returned to the caller until after the callee has responded to the
      canceled call.  In this case the caller may receive "RESULT" or
      "ERROR" depending whether the callee finishes processing the
      invocation or the interrupt first.

   o  *killnowait*: The pending call is canceled and "ERROR" is sent
      immediately back to the caller.  "INTERRUPT" is sent to the callee
      and any response to the invocation or interrupt from the callee is
      discarded when received.

   If the callee does not support call canceling, then behavior is
   *skip*.

   A _Caller_ cancels a remote procedure call initiated (but not yet
   finished) by sending a "CANCEL" message to the _Dealer_:

       [CANCEL, CALL.Request|id, Options|dict]

   A _Dealer_ cancels an invocation of an endpoint initiated (but not
   yet finished) by sending a "INTERRUPT" message to the _Callee_:

       [INTERRUPT, INVOCATION.Request|id, Options|dict]

   Options:

       CANCEL.Options.mode|string == "skip" | "kill" | "killnowait"

   Note: After the _Dealer_ sends an "INTERRUPT" when mode="killnowait",
   any responses from the _Callee_ are ignored.  This means that it is
   not necessary for the _Callee_ to respond with an "ERROR" message,
   when mode="killnowait", since the _Dealer_ ignores it.

14.3.4.2.  Feature Announcement

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Callers_ ("role :=
   "caller""), _Callees_ ("role := "callee"") and _Dealers_ ("role :=
   "dealer"") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.call_canceling|bool := true

14.3.5.  Caller Identification

14.3.5.1.  Feature Definition

   A _Caller_ MAY *request* the disclosure of its identity (its WAMP
   session ID) to endpoints of a routed call via

       CALL.Options.disclose_me|bool := true

   _Example_

       [48, 7814135, {"disclose_me": true}, "com.myapp.echo",
           ["Hello, world!"]]

   If above call is issued by a _Caller_ with WAMP session ID "3335656",
   the _Dealer_ sends an "INVOCATION" message to _Callee_ with the
   _Caller's_ WAMP session ID in "INVOCATION.Details.caller":

   _Example_

       [68, 6131533, 9823526, {"caller": 3335656}, ["Hello, world!"]]

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   Note that a _Dealer_ MAY disclose the identity of a _Caller_ even
   without the _Caller_ having explicitly requested to do so when the
   _Dealer_ configuration (for the called procedure) is setup to do so.

   A _Dealer_ MAY deny a _Caller's_ request to disclose its identity:

   _Example_

       [8, 7814135, "wamp.error.disclose_me.not_allowed"]

   A _Callee_ MAY *request* the disclosure of caller identity via

       REGISTER.Options.disclose_caller|bool := true

   _Example_

       [64, 927639114088448, {"disclose_caller":true},
           "com.maypp.add2"]

   With the above registration, the registered procedure is called with
   the caller's sessionID as part of the call details object.

14.3.5.2.  Feature Announcement

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Callers_ ("role :=
   "caller""), _Callees_ ("role := "callee"") and _Dealers_ ("role :=
   "dealer"") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.
            caller_identification|bool := true

14.3.6.  Call Trust Levels

14.3.6.1.  Feature Definition

   A _Dealer_ may be configured to automatically assign _trust levels_
   to calls issued by _Callers_ according to the _Dealer_ configuration
   on a per-procedure basis and/or depending on the application defined
   role of the (authenticated) _Caller_.

   A _Dealer_ supporting trust level will provide

       INVOCATION.Details.trustlevel|integer

   in an "INVOCATION" message sent to a _Callee_. The trustlevel "0"
   means lowest trust, and higher integers represent (application-
   defined) higher levels of trust.

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   _Example_

       [68, 6131533, 9823526, {"trustlevel": 2}, ["Hello, world!"]]

   In above event, the _Dealer_ has (by configuration and/or other
   information) deemed the call (and hence the invocation) to be of
   trustlevel "2".

14.3.6.2.  Feature Announcement

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Callees_ ("role :=
   "callee"") and _Dealers_ ("role := "dealer"") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.call_trustlevels|bool := true

14.3.7.  Registration Meta API

14.3.7.1.  Feature Definition

14.3.7.1.1.  Introduction

   *Registration Meta Events* are fired when registrations are first
   created, when _Callees_ are attached (removed) to (from) a
   registration, and when registrations are finally destroyed.

   Furthermore, WAMP allows actively retrieving information about
   registrations via *Registration Meta Procedures*.

   Meta-events are created by the router itself.  This means that the
   events as well as the data received when calling a meta-procedure can
   be accorded the same trust level as the router.

      Note that an implementation that only supports a _Broker_ or
      _Dealer_ role, not both at the same time, essentially cannot offer
      the *Registration Meta API*, as it requires both roles to support
      this feature.

14.3.7.1.2.  Registration Meta Events

   A client can subscribe to the following registration meta-events,
   which cover the lifecycle of a registration:

   o  "wamp.registration.on_create": Fired when a registration is
      created through a registration request for an URI which was
      previously without a registration.

   o  "wamp.registration.on_register": Fired when a _Callee_ session is
      added to a registration.

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   o  "wamp.registration.on_unregister": Fired when a _Callee_ session
      is removed from a registration.

   o  "wamp.registration.on_delete": Fired when a registration is
      deleted after the last _Callee_ session attached to it has been
      removed.

   A "wamp.registration.on_register" event MUST be fired subsequent to a
   "wamp.registration.on_create" event, since the first registration
   results in both the creation of the registration and the addition of
   a session.

   Similarly, the "wamp.registration.on_delete" event MUST be preceded
   by a "wamp.registration.on_unregister" event.

   *Registration Meta Events* MUST be dispatched by the router to the
   same realm as the WAMP session which triggered the event.

14.3.7.1.2.1.  wamp.registration.on_create

   Fired when a registration is created through a registration request
   for an URI which was previously without a registration.  The event
   payload consists of positional arguments:

   o  "session|id": The session ID performing the registration request.

   o  "RegistrationDetails|dict": Information on the created
      registration.

   *Object Schemas*

       RegistrationDetails :=
       {
           "id": registration|id,
           "created": time_created|iso_8601_string,
           "uri": procedure|uri,
           "match": match_policy|string,
           "invoke": invocation_policy|string
       }

14.3.7.1.2.2.  wamp.registration.on_register

   Fired when a session is added to a registration.  The event payload
   consists of positional arguments:

   o  "session|id": The ID of the session being added to a registration.

      is being added.

14.3.7.1.2.3.  wamp.registration.on_unregister

   Fired when a session is removed from a subscription.  The event
   payload consists of positional arguments:

   o  "session|id": The ID of the session being removed from a
      registration.

   o  "registration|id": The ID of the registration from which a session
      is being removed.

14.3.7.1.2.4.  wamp.registration.on_delete

   Fired when a registration is deleted after the last session attached
   to it has been removed.  The event payload consists of positional
   arguments:

   o  "session|id": The ID of the last session being removed from a
      registration.

   o  "registration|id": The ID of the registration being deleted.

14.3.7.1.3.  Registration Meta-Procedures

   A client can actively retrieve information about registrations via
   the following meta-procedures:

   o  "wamp.registration.list": Retrieves registration IDs listed
      according to match policies.

   o  "wamp.registration.lookup": Obtains the registration (if any)
      managing a procedure, according to some match policy.

   o  "wamp.registration.match": Obtains the registration best matching
      a given procedure URI.

   o  "wamp.registration.get": Retrieves information on a particular
      registration.

14.3.8.  Pattern-based Registrations

14.3.8.1.  Feature Definition

14.3.8.1.1.  Introduction

   By default, _Callees_ register procedures with *exact matching
   policy*. That is a call will only be routed to a _Callee_ by the
   _Dealer_ if the procedure called ("CALL.Procedure") _exactly_ matches
   the endpoint registered ("REGISTER.Procedure").

   A _Callee_ might want to register procedures based on a _pattern_.
   This can be useful to reduce the number of individual registrations
   to be set up or to subscribe to a open set of topics, not known
   beforehand by the _Subscriber_.

   If the _Dealer_ and the _Callee_ support *pattern-based
   registrations*, this matching can happen by

   o  *prefix-matching policy*

   o  *wildcard-matching policy*

14.3.8.1.2.  Prefix Matching

   A _Callee_ requests *prefix-matching policy* with a registration
   request by setting

       REGISTER.Options.match|string := "prefix"

   _Example_

       [
           64,
           612352435,
           {
               "match": "prefix"
           },
           "com.myapp.myobject1"
       ]

   When a *prefix-matching policy* is in place, any call with a
   procedure that has "REGISTER.Procedure" as a _prefix_ will match the
   registration, and potentially be routed to _Callees_ on that
   registration.

   In above example, the following calls with "CALL.Procedure"

   o  "com.myapp.myobject1.myprocedure1"

   o  "com.myapp.myobject1-mysubobject1"

   o  "com.myapp.myobject1.mysubobject1.myprocedure1"

   o  "com.myapp.myobject1"

   will all apply for call routing.  A call with one of the following
   "CALL.Procedure"

   o  "com.myapp.myobject2"

   o  "com.myapp.myobject"

   will not apply.

14.3.8.1.3.  Wildcard Matching

   A _Callee_ requests *wildcard-matching policy* with a registration
   request by setting

       REGISTER.Options.match|string := "wildcard"

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   Wildcard-matching allows to provide wildcards for *whole* URI
   components.

   _Example_

       [
           64,
           612352435,
           {
               "match": "wildcard"
           },
           "com.myapp..myprocedure1"
       ]

   In the above registration request, the 3rd URI component is empty,
   which signals a wildcard in that URI component position.  In this
   example, calls with "CALL.Procedure" e.g.

   o  "com.myapp.myobject1.myprocedure1"

   o  "com.myapp.myobject2.myprocedure1"

   will all apply for call routing.  Calls with "CALL.Procedure" e.g.

   o  "com.myapp.myobject1.myprocedure1.mysubprocedure1"

   o  "com.myapp.myobject1.myprocedure2"

   o  "com.myapp2.myobject1.myprocedure1"

   will not apply for call routing.

   When a single call matches more than one of a _Callees_
   registrations, the call MAY be routed for invocation on multiple
   registrations, depending on call settings.

14.3.8.1.4.  General

14.3.8.1.4.1.  No set semantics

   Since each _Callee_'s' registrations "stands on its own", there is no
   _set semantics_ implied by pattern-based registrations.

   E.g. a _Callee_ cannot register to a broad pattern, and then
   unregister from a subset of that broad pattern to form a more complex
   registration.  Each registration is separate.

14.3.8.1.4.2.  Calls matching multiple registrations

   There can be situations, when some call URI matches more then one
   registration.  In this case a call is routed to one and only one best
   matched RPC registration, or fails with ERROR
   "wamp.error.no_such_procedure".

   The following algorithm MUST be applied to find a single RPC
   registration to which a call is routed:

   1.  Check for exact matching registration.  If this match exists --
       use it.

   2.  If there are prefix-based registrations, find the registration
       with the longest prefix match.  Longest means it has more URI
       components matched, e.g. for call URI "a1.b2.c3.d4" registration
       "a1.b2.c3" has higher priority than registration "a1.b2".  If
       this match exists -- use it.

   3.  If there are wildcard-based registrations, find the registration
       with the longest portion of URI components matched before each
       wildcard.  E.g. for call URI "a1.b2.c3.d4" registration
       "a1.b2..d4" has higher priority than registration "a1...d4", see
       below for more complex examples.  If this match exists -- use it.

   4.  If there is no exact match, no prefix match, and no wildcard
       match, then _Dealer_ MUST return ERROR
       "wamp.error.no_such_procedure".

14.3.9.  Shared Registration

   Feature status: *alpha*

14.3.9.1.  Feature Definition

   As a default, only a single *Callee* may register a procedure for an
   URI.

   There are use cases where more flexibility is required.  As an
   example, for an application component with a high computing load,
   several instances may run, and load balancing of calls across these
   may be desired.  As another example, in an application a second or
   third component providing a procedure may run, which are only to be
   called in case the primary component is no longer reachable (hot
   standby).

   When shared registrations are supported, then the first *Callee* to
   register a procedure for a particular URI MAY determine that
   additional registrations for this URI are allowed, and what
   *Invocation Rules* to apply in case such additional registrations are
   made.

   This is done through setting

       REGISTER.Options.invoke|string := <invocation_policy>

   where "<invocation_policy>" is one of

   o  'single'

   o  'roundrobin'

   o  'random'

   o  'first'

   o  'last'

   If the option is not set, 'single' is applied as a default.

   With 'single', the *Dealer* MUST fail all subsequent attempts to
   register a procedure for the URI while the registration remains in
   existence.

   With the other values, the *Dealer* MUST fail all subsequent attempts
   to register a procedure for the URI where the value for this option
   does not match that of the initial registration.

14.3.9.1.1.  Load Balancing

   For sets of registrations registered using either 'roundrobin' or
   'random', load balancing is performed across calls to the URI.

   For 'roundrobin', callees are picked subsequently from the list of
   registrations (ordered by the order of registration), with the
   picking looping back to the beginning of the list once the end has
   been reached.

   For 'random' a callee is picked randomly from the list of
   registrations for each call.

14.3.9.1.2.  Hot Stand-By

   For sets of registrations registered using either 'first' or 'last',
   the first respectively last callee on the current list of
   registrations (ordered by the order of registration) is called.

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Callees_ ("role :=

14.3.10.  Sharded Registration

   Feature status: *sketch*

14.3.10.1.  Feature Definition

   *Sharded Registrations* are intended to allow calling a procedure
   which is offered by a sharded database, by routing the call to a
   single shard.

14.3.10.2.  "Partitioned" Calls

   If "CALL.Options.runmode == "partition"", then "CALL.Options.rkey"
   MUST be present.

   The call is then routed to all endpoints that were registered ..

   The call is then processed as for "All" Calls.

14.3.10.3.  Feature Announcement

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Callers_ ("role :=
   "caller""), _Callees_ ("role := "callee"") and _Dealers_ ("role :=
   "dealer"") via

            registration_revocation|bool := true

   If the _Callee_ does not support registration_revocation, the
   _Dealer_ may still revoke a registration to support administrative
   functionality.  In this case, the _Dealer_ MUST NOT send an
   *UNREGISTERED* message to the _Callee_. The _Callee_ MAY use the
   registration meta event "wamp.registration.on_unregister" to
   determine whether a session is removed from a registration.

14.3.11.2.  Feature Definition

   This feature allows a _Dealer_ to actively revoke a previously
   granted registration.  To achieve this, the existing UNREGISTERED
   message is extended as described below.

14.3.11.3.  Extending UNREGISTERED

   When revoking a registration, the router has no request ID to reply
   to.  So it's set to zero and another argument is appended to indicate
   which registration to revoke.  Optionally, a reason why the
   registration was revoked is also appended.

       [UNREGISTERED, 0, Details|dict]

   where

   o  "Details.registration|bool" MUST be a previously issued
      registration ID.

   o  "Details.reason|string" MAY provide a reason as to why the
      registration was revoked.

    [67, 0, {"registration": 1293722, "reason": "moving endpoint to other callee"}]

14.3.12.  Procedure Reflection

   Feature status: *sketch*

   _Reflection_ denotes the ability of WAMP peers to examine the
   procedures, topics and errors provided or used by other peers.

   I.e. a WAMP _Caller_, _Callee_, _Subscriber_ or _Publisher_ may be
   interested in retrieving a machine readable list and description of
   WAMP procedures and topics it is authorized to access or provide in
   the context of a WAMP session with a _Dealer_ or _Broker_.

   Reflection may be useful in the following cases:

   o  documentation

   o  discoverability

   o  generating stubs and proxies

   WAMP predefines the following procedures for performing run-time
   reflection on WAMP peers which act as _Brokers_ and/or _Dealers_.

   Predefined WAMP reflection procedures to _list_ resources by type:

       wamp.reflection.topic.list
       wamp.reflection.procedure.list
       wamp.reflection.error.list

   Predefined WAMP reflection procedures to _describe_ resources by
   type:

       wamp.reflection.topic.describe
       wamp.reflection.procedure.describe
       wamp.reflection.error.describe

   A peer that acts as a _Broker_ SHOULD announce support for the
   reflection API by sending

       HELLO.Details.roles.broker.reflection|bool := true

   A peer that acts as a _Dealer_ SHOULD announce support for the
   reflection API by sending

       HELLO.Details.roles.dealer.reflection|bool := true

      Since _Brokers_ might provide (broker) procedures and _Dealers_
      might provide (dealer) topics, both SHOULD implement the complete
      API above (even if the peer only implements one of _Broker_ or
      _Dealer_ roles).

   *Reflection*

   A topic or procedure is defined for reflection:

       wamp.reflect.define

   A topic or procedure was asked to be described (reflected upon):

       wamp.reflect.describe

14.4.  Advanced PubSub Features

14.4.1.  Subscriber Black- and Whitelisting

14.4.1.1.  Introduction

   *Subscriber Black- and Whitelisting* is an advanced _Broker_ feature
   where a _Publisher_ is able to restrict the set of receivers of a
   published event.

   Under normal Publish & Subscriber event dispatching, a _Broker_ will
   dispatch a published event to all (authorized) _Subscribers_ other
   than the _Publisher_ itself.  This set of receivers can be further
   reduced on a per-publication basis by the _Publisher_ using
   *Subscriber Black- and Whitelisting*.

   The _Publisher_ can explicitly *exclude* _Subscribers_ based on WAMP
   "sessionid", "authid" or "authrole".  This is referred to as
   *Blacklisting*.

   A _Publisher_ may also explicitly define a *eligible* list of
   *Subscribers** based on WAMP "sessionid", "authid" or "authrole".
   This is referred to as *Whitelisting*.

14.4.1.2.  Use Cases

14.4.1.2.1.  Avoiding Callers from being self-notified

   Consider an application that exposes a procedure to update a product
   price.  The procedure might not only actually update the product
   price (e.g. in a backend database), but additionally publish an event
   with the updated product price, so that *all* application components
   get notified actively of the new price.

   However, the application might want to exclude the originator of the
   product price update (the *Caller* of the price update procedure)
   from receiving the update event - as the originator naturally already
   knows the new price, and might get confused when it receives an
   update the *Caller* has triggered himself.

   The product price update procedure can use
   "PUBLISH.Options.exclude|list[int]" to exclude the *Caller* of the
   procedure.

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


      Note that the product price update procedure needs to know the
      session ID of the *Caller* to be able to exclude him.  For this,
      please see *Caller Identification*.

   A similar approach can be used for other CRUD-like procedures.

14.4.1.2.2.  Restricting receivers of sensitive information

   Consider an application with users that have different "authroles",
   such as "manager" and "staff" that publishes events with updates to
   "customers".  The topics being published to could be structured like

       com.example.myapp.customer.<customer ID>

   The application might want to restrict the receivers of customer
   updates depending on the "authrole" of the user.  E.g. a user
   authenticated under "authrole" "manager" might be allowed to receive
   any kind of customer update, including personal and business
   sensitive information.  A user under "authrole" "staff" might only be
   allowed to receive a subset of events.

   The application can publish *all* customer updates to the *same*
   topic "com.example.myapp.customer.<customer ID>" and use
   "PUBLISH.Options.eligible_authrole|list[string]" to safely restrict
   the set of actual receivers as desired.

14.4.1.3.  Feature Definition

   A _Publisher_ may restrict the actual receivers of an event from the
   set of _Subscribers_ through the use of

   o  Blacklisting Options

      *  "PUBLISH.Options.exclude|list[int]"

      *  "PUBLISH.Options.exclude_authid|list[string]"

      *  "PUBLISH.Options.exclude_authrole|list[string]"

   o  Whitelisting Options

      *  "PUBLISH.Options.eligible|list[int]"

      *  "PUBLISH.Options.eligible_authid|list[string]"

      *  "PUBLISH.Options.eligible_authrole|list[string]"

   "PUBLISH.Options.exclude" is a list of integers with WAMP
   "sessionids" providing an explicit list of (potential) _Subscribers_
   that won't receive a published event, even though they may be
   subscribed.  In other words, "PUBLISH.Options.exclude" is a
   *blacklist* of (potential) _Subscribers_.

   "PUBLISH.Options.eligible" is a list of integers with WAMP WAMP
   "sessionids" providing an explicit list of (potential) _Subscribers_
   that are allowed to receive a published event.  In other words,
   "PUBLISH.Options.eligible" is a *whitelist* of (potential)
   _Subscribers_.

   The "exclude_authid", "exclude_authrole", "eligible_authid" and
   "eligible_authrole" options work similar, but not on the basis of
   WAMP "sessionid", but "authid" and "authrole".

   An (authorized) _Subscriber_ to topic T will receive an event
   published to T if and only if all of the following statements hold
   true:

   1.  if there is an "eligible" attribute present, the _Subscriber_'s
       "sessionid" is in this list

   2.  if there is an "eligible_authid" attribute present, the
       _Subscriber_'s "authid" is in this list

   3.  if there is an "eligible_authrole" attribute present, the
       _Subscriber_'s "authrole" is in this list

   4.  if there is an "exclude attribute" present, the _Subscriber_'s
       "sessionid" is NOT in this list

   5.  if there is an "exclude_authid" attribute present, the
       _Subscriber_'s "authid" is NOT in this list

   6.  if there is an "exclude_authrole" attribute present, the
       _Subscriber_'s "authrole" is NOT in this list

   For example, if both "PUBLISH.Options.exclude" and
   "PUBLISH.Options.eligible" are present, the _Broker_ will dispatch
   events published only to _Subscribers_ that are not explicitly
   excluded in "PUBLISH.Options.exclude" *and* which are explicitly
   eligible via "PUBLISH.Options.eligible".

14.4.2.  Publisher Exclusion

14.4.2.1.  Feature Definition

   By default, a _Publisher_ of an event will *not* itself receive an
   event published, even when subscribed to the "Topic" the _Publisher_
   is publishing to.  This behavior can be overridden using this
   feature.

   To override the exclusion of a publisher from its own publication,
   the "PUBLISH" message must include the following option:

       PUBLISH.Options.exclude_me|bool

   When publishing with "PUBLISH.Options.exclude_me := false", the
   _Publisher_ of the event will receive that event, if it is subscribed
   to the "Topic" published to.

           "com.myapp.mytopic1",
           ["Hello, world!"]
       ]

   In this example, the _Publisher_ will receive the published event, if
   it is subscribed to "com.myapp.mytopic1".

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Publishers_ ("role :=

14.4.3.  Publisher Identification

14.4.3.1.  Feature Definition

   A _Publisher_ may request the disclosure of its identity (its WAMP
   session ID) to receivers of a published event by setting

       PUBLISH.Options.disclose_me|bool := true

   _Example_

       [16, 239714735, {"disclose_me": true}, "com.myapp.mytopic1",
           ["Hello, world!"]]

   If above event is published by a _Publisher_ with WAMP session ID
   "3335656", the _Broker_ would send an "EVENT" message to
   _Subscribers_ with the _Publisher's_ WAMP session ID in
   "EVENT.Details.publisher":

   _Example_

       [36, 5512315355, 4429313566, {"publisher": 3335656},
           ["Hello, world!"]]

   Note that a _Broker_ may deny a _Publisher's_ request to disclose its
   identity:

   _Example_

       [8, 239714735, {}, "wamp.error.option_disallowed.disclose_me"]

   A _Broker_ may also (automatically) disclose the identity of a
   _Publisher_ even without the _Publisher_ having explicitly requested
   to do so when the _Broker_ configuration (for the publication topic)
   is set up to do so.

14.4.3.2.  Feature Announcement

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Publishers_ ("role :=
   "publisher""), _Brokers_ ("role := "broker"") and _Subscribers_
   ("role := "subscriber"") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.
           publisher_identification|bool := true

14.4.4.  Publication Trust Levels

14.4.4.1.  Feature Definition

   A _Broker_ may be configured to automatically assign _trust levels_
   to events published by _Publishers_ according to the _Broker_
   configuration on a per-topic basis and/or depending on the
   application defined role of the (authenticated) _Publisher_.

   A _Broker_ supporting trust level will provide

       EVENT.Details.trustlevel|integer

   in an "EVENT" message sent to a _Subscriber_. The trustlevel "0"
   means lowest trust, and higher integers represent (application-
   defined) higher levels of trust.

   _Example_

       [36, 5512315355, 4429313566, {"trustlevel": 2},
           ["Hello, world!"]]

   In above event, the _Broker_ has (by configuration and/or other
   information) deemed the event publication to be of trustlevel "2".

14.4.4.2.  Feature Announcement

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Subscribers_ ("role :=
   "subscriber"") and _Brokers_ ("role := "broker"") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.
           publication_trustlevels|bool := true

14.4.5.  Subscription Meta API

   Within an application, it may be desirable for a publisher to know
   whether a publication to a specific topic currently makes sense, i.e.
   whether there are any subscribers who would receive an event based on
   the publication.  It may also be desirable to keep a current count of
   subscribers to a topic to then be able to filter out any subscribers
   who are not supposed to receive an event.

   Subscription _meta-events_ are fired when topics are first created,
   when clients subscribe/unsubscribe to them, and when topics are
   deleted.  WAMP allows retrieving information about subscriptions via
   subscription _meta-procedures_.

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by Brokers via

       HELLO.Details.roles.broker.features.subscription_meta_api|
           bool := true

   Meta-events are created by the router itself.  This means that the
   events as well as the data received when calling a meta-procedure can
   be accorded the same trust level as the router.

14.4.5.1.  Subscription Meta-Events

   A client can subscribe to the following session meta-events, which
   cover the lifecycle of a subscription:

   o  "wamp.subscription.on_create": Fired when a subscription is
      created through a subscription request for a topic which was
      previously without subscribers.

   o  "wamp.subscription.on_subscribe": Fired when a session is added to
      a subscription.

   o  "wamp.subscription.on_unsubscribe": Fired when a session is
      removed from a subscription.

   o  "wamp.subscription.on_delete": Fired when a subscription is
      deleted after the last session attached to it has been removed.

   A "wamp.subscription.on_subscribe" event MUST always be fired
   subsequent to a "wamp.subscription.on_create" event, since the first
   subscribe results in both the creation of the subscription and the
   addition of a session.  Similarly, the "wamp.subscription.on_delete"
   event MUST always be preceded by a "wamp.subscription.on_unsubscribe"
   event.

   The WAMP subscription meta events shall be dispatched by the router
   to the same realm as the WAMP session which triggered the event.

14.4.5.1.1.  Meta-Event Specifications

14.4.5.1.1.1.  wamp.subscription.on_create

14.4.6.  Pattern-based Subscriptions

14.4.6.1.  Introduction

   By default, _Subscribers_ subscribe to topics with *exact matching
   policy*. That is an event will only be dispatched to a _Subscriber_

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   by the _Broker_ if the topic published to ("PUBLISH.Topic") _exactly_
   matches the topic subscribed to ("SUBSCRIBE.Topic").

   A _Subscriber_ might want to subscribe to topics based on a
   _pattern_. This can be useful to reduce the number of individual
   subscriptions to be set up and to subscribe to topics the
   _Subscriber_ is not aware of at the time of subscription, or which do
   not yet exist at this time.

   If the _Broker_ and the _Subscriber_ support *pattern-based
   subscriptions*, this matching can happen by

   o  prefix-matching policy

   o  wildcard-matching policy

14.4.6.2.  Prefix Matching

   A _Subscriber_ requests *prefix-matching policy* with a subscription
   request by setting

       SUBSCRIBE.Options.match|string := "prefix"

   _Example_

       [
           32,
           912873614,
           {
               "match": "prefix"
           },
           "com.myapp.topic.emergency"
       ]

   When a *prefix-matching policy* is in place, any event with a topic
   that has "SUBSCRIBE.Topic" as a _prefix_ will match the subscription,
   and potentially be delivered to _Subscribers_ on the subscription.

   In the above example, events with "PUBLISH.Topic"

   o  "com.myapp.topic.emergency.11"

   o  "com.myapp.topic.emergency-low"

   o  "com.myapp.topic.emergency.category.severe"

   o  "com.myapp.topic.emergency"

   will all apply for dispatching.  An event with "PUBLISH.Topic" e.g.
   "com.myapp.topic.emerge" will not apply.

14.4.6.3.  Wildcard Matching

   A _Subscriber_ requests *wildcard-matching policy* with a
   subscription request by setting

       SUBSCRIBE.Options.match|string := "wildcard"

   Wildcard-matching allows to provide wildcards for *whole* URI
   components.

   _Example_

       [
           32,
           912873614,
           {
               "match": "wildcard"
           },
           "com.myapp..userevent"
       ]

   In above subscription request, the 3rd URI component is empty, which
   signals a wildcard in that URI component position.  In this example,
   events with "PUBLISH.Topic"

   o  "com.myapp.foo.userevent"

   o  "com.myapp.bar.userevent"

   o  "com.myapp.a12.userevent"

   will all apply for dispatching.  Events with "PUBLISH.Topic"

   o  "com.myapp.foo.userevent.bar"

   o  "com.myapp.foo.user"

   o  "com.myapp2.foo.userevent"

   will not apply for dispatching.

14.4.6.4.  General

14.4.6.4.1.  No set semantics

   Since each _Subscriber's_ subscription "stands on its own", there is
   no _set semantics_ implied by pattern-based subscriptions.

   E.g. a _Subscriber_ cannot subscribe to a broad pattern, and then
   unsubscribe from a subset of that broad pattern to form a more
   complex subscription.  Each subscription is separate.

14.4.6.4.2.  Events matching multiple subscriptions

   When a single event matches more than one of a _Subscriber's_
   subscriptions, the event will be delivered for each subscription.

   The _Subscriber_ can detect the delivery of that same event on
   multiple subscriptions via "EVENT.PUBLISHED.Publication", which will
   be identical.

14.4.6.4.3.  Concrete topic published to

   If a subscription was established with a pattern-based matching
   policy, a _Broker_ MUST supply the original "PUBLISH.Topic" as
   provided by the _Publisher_ in

       EVENT.Details.topic|uri

   to the _Subscribers_.

   _Example_

       [
           36,
           5512315355,
           4429313566,
           {
               "topic": "com.myapp.topic.emergency.category.severe"

14.4.8.  Event History

14.4.8.1.  Feature Definition

   Instead of complex QoS for message delivery, a _Broker_ may provide
   _message history_. A _Subscriber_ is responsible to handle overlaps
   (duplicates) when it wants "exactly-once" message processing across
   restarts.

   The _Broker_ may allow for configuration on a per-topic basis.

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   The event history may be transient or persistent message history
   (surviving _Broker_ restarts).

   A _Broker_ that implements _event history_ must (also) announce role
   "HELLO.roles.callee", indicate "HELLO.roles.broker.history == 1" and
   provide the following (builtin) procedures.

   A _Caller_ can request message history by calling the _Broker_
   procedure

       wamp.topic.history.last

   with "Arguments = [topic|uri, limit|integer]" where

   o  "topic" is the topic to retrieve event history for

   o  "limit" indicates the number of last N events to retrieve

   or by calling

       wamp.topic.history.since

   with "Arguments = [topic|uri, timestamp|string]" where

   o  "topic" is the topic to retrieve event history for

   o  "timestamp" indicates the UTC timestamp since when to retrieve the
      events in the ISO-8601 format "yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss:SSSZ" (e.g.
      ""2013-12-21T13:43:11:000Z"")

   or by calling

       wamp.topic.history.after

   with "Arguments = [topic|uri, publication|id]"

   o  "topic" is the topic to retrieve event history for

   o  "publication" is the id of an event which marks the start of the
      events to retrieve from history

   _FIXME_

   1.  Should we use "topic|uri" or "subscription|id" in "Arguments"?

       *  Since we need to be able to get history for pattern-based
          subscriptions as well, a subscription|id makes more sense:

          create pattern-based subscription, then get the event history
          for this.

       *  The only restriction then is that we may not get event history
          without a current subscription covering the events.  This is a
          minor inconvenience at worst.

   2.  Can "wamp.topic.history.after" be implemented (efficiently) at
       all?

   3.  How does that interact with pattern-based subscriptions?

   4.  The same question as with the subscriber lists applies where: to
       stay within our separation of roles, we need a broker + a
       separate peer which implements the callee role.  Here we do not
       have a mechanism to get the history from the broker.

   5.  How are black/whitelisted sessionIDs treated?  A client which
       requests event history will have a different sessionID than on
       previous connections, and may receive events for which it was
       excluded in the previous session, or not receive events for which
       it was whitelisted. - see <https://github.com/wamp-proto/wamp-

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Subscribers_ ("role :=
   "subscriber"") and _Brokers_ ("role := "broker"") via

   the subscription meta event "wamp.subscription.on_unsubscribe" to
   determine whether a session is removed from a subscription.

14.4.9.2.  Feature Definition

   This feature allows a _Broker_ to actively revoke a previously
   granted subscription.  To achieve this, the existing UNSUBSCRIBED
   message is extended as described below.

14.4.9.3.  Extending UNSUBSCRIBED

   When revoking a subscription, the router has no request ID to reply
   to.  So it's set to zero and another argument is appended to indicate
   which subscription to revoke.  Optionally, a reason why the
   subscription was revoked is also appended.

       [UNSUBSCRIBED, 0, Details|dict]

   where

   o  "Details.subscription|bool" MUST be a previously issued
      subscription ID.

   o  "Details.reason|string" MAY provide a reason as to why the
      subscription was revoked.

   _Example_

    [35, 0, {"subscription": 1293722, "reason": "no longer authorized"}]

14.4.11.  Testament

14.4.11.1.  Feature Definition

   When a WAMP client disconnects, or the WAMP session is destroyed, it
   may want to notify other subscribers or publish some fixed data.
   Since a client may disconnect uncleanly, this can't be done reliably
   by them.  A _Testament_, however, set on the server, can be reliably
   sent by the _Broker_ once either the WAMP session has detached or the
   client connection has been lost, and allows this functionality.  It
   can be triggered when a Session is either detached (the client has
   disconnected from it, or frozen it, in the case of Session
   Resumption) or destroyed (when the WAMP session no longer exists on
   the server).

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   This allows clients that otherwise would not be able to know when
   other clients disconnect get a notification (for example, by using
   the WAMP Session Meta API) with a format the disconnected client
   chose.

14.4.11.2.  Testament Meta Procedures

   A _Client_ can call the following procedures to set/flush Testaments:

   o  "wamp.session.add_testament" to add a Testament which will be
      published on a particular topic when the Session is detached or
      destroyed.

   o  "wamp.session.flush_testaments" to remove the Testaments for that
      Session, either for when it is detached or destroyed.

14.4.11.2.1.  wamp.session.add_testament

   Adds a new testament:

   *Positional arguments*

   1.  "topic|uri" - the topic to publish the event on

   2.  "args|list" - positional arguments for the event

   3.  "kwargs|dict" - keyword arguments for the event

   *Keyword arguments*

   1.  "publish_options|dict" - options for the event when it is
       published -- see "Publish.Options".  Not all options may be
       honoured (for example, "acknowledge").  By default, there are no
       options.

   2.  "scope|string" - When the testament should be published.  Valid
       values are "detached" (when the WAMP session is detached, for
       example, when using Event Retention) or "destroyed" (when the
       WAMP session is finalized and destroyed on the Broker).  Default
       MUST be "destroyed".

   "wamp.session.add_testament" does not return a value.

14.4.11.2.2.  wamp.session.flush_testaments

   Removes testaments for the given scope:

   *Keyword arguments*

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   1.  "scope|string" - Which set of testaments to be removed.  Valid
       values are the same as "wamp.session.add_testament", and the
       default MUST be "destroyed".

   "wamp.session.flush_testaments" does not return a value.

14.4.11.3.  Testaments in Use

   A _Client_ that wishes to send some form of data when their _Session_
   ends unexpectedly or their _Transport_ becomes lost can set a
   testament using the WAMP Testament Meta API, when a _Router_ supports
   it.  For example, a client may call "add_testament" (this example
   uses the implicit "scope" option of "destroyed"):

   yield self.call('wamp.session.add_testament',
                   'com.myapp.mytopic', ['Seeya!'], {'my_name': 'app1'})

   The _Router_ will then store this information on the WAMP Session,
   either in a "detached" or "destroyed" bucket, in the order they were
   added.  A client MUST be able to set multiple testaments per-scope.
   If the _Router_ does not support Session Resumption (therefore
   removing the distinction between a detached and destroyed session),
   it MUST still use these two separate buckets to allow
   "wamp.session.flush_testaments" to work.

   When a _Session_ is _detached_, the _Router_ will inspect it for any
   Testaments in the "detached" scope, and publish them in the order
   that the Router received them, on the specified topic, with the
   specified arguments, keyword arguments, and publish options.  The
   _Router_ MAY ignore publish options that do not make sense for a
   Testament (for example, acknowledged publishes).

   When a _Session_ is going to be _destroyed_, the _Router_ will
   inspect it for any Testaments in the "destroyed" scope, and publish
   them in the same way as it would for the "detached" scope, in the
   order that they were received.

   A _Router_ that does not allow Session Resumption MUST send
   "detached"-scope Testaments before "destroyed"-scope Testaments.

   A _Client_ can also clear testaments if the information is no longer
   relevant (for example, it is shutting down completely cleanly).  For
   example, a client may call "wamp.session.flush_testaments":

    yield self.call('wamp.session.flush_testaments', scope='detached')
    yield self.call('wamp.session.flush_testaments', scope='destroyed')

   The _Router_ will then flush all Testaments stored for the given
   scope.

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Dealers_ ("role :=
   "dealer"") via

14.5.  Other Advanced Features

14.5.1.  Session Meta API

14.5.1.1.  Introduction

   WAMP enables the monitoring of when sessions join a realm on the
   router or when they leave it via *Session Meta Events*. It also
   allows retrieving information about currently connected sessions via
   *Session Meta Procedures*.

   Meta events are created by the router itself.  This means that the
   events, as well as the data received when calling a meta procedure,
   can be accorded the same trust level as the router.

      Note that an implementation that only supports a _Broker_ or
      _Dealer_ role, not both at the same time, essentially cannot offer
      the *Session Meta API*, as it requires both roles to support this
      feature.

14.5.1.2.  Session Meta Events

   A client can subscribe to the following session meta-events, which
   cover the lifecycle of a session:

   o  "wamp.session.on_join": Fired when a session joins a realm on the
      router.

   o  "wamp.session.on_leave": Fired when a session leaves a realm on
      the router or is disconnected.

   *Session Meta Events* MUST be dispatched by the _Router_ to the same
   realm as the WAMP session which triggered the event.

14.5.1.2.1.  wamp.session.on_join

   Fired when a session joins a realm on the router.  The event payload
   consists of a single positional argument "details|dict":

   o  "session|id" - The session ID of the session that joined

   o  "authid|string" - The authentication ID of the session that joined

   o  "authrole|string" - The authentication role of the session that
      joined

   o  "authmethod|string" - The authentication method that was used for
      authentication the session that joined

   o  "authprovider|string"- The provider that performed the
      authentication of the session that joined

   o  "transport|dict" - Optional, implementation defined information
      about the WAMP transport the joined session is running over.

      See *Authentication* for a description of the "authid",
      "authrole", "authmethod" and "authprovider" properties.

14.5.1.2.2.  wamp.session.on_leave

   Fired when a session leaves a realm on the router or is disconnected.
   The event payload consists of three positional arguments:

   o  "session|id" - The session ID of the session that left

   o  "authid"|string` - The authentication ID of the session that left

   o  "authrole|string" - The authentication role of the session that
      left

14.5.1.3.  Session Meta Procedures

   A client can actively retrieve information about sessions, or
   forcefully close sessions, via the following meta-procedures:

   o  "wamp.session.count": Obtains the number of sessions currently
      attached to the realm.

   o  "wamp.session.list": Retrieves a list of the session IDs for all
      sessions currently attached to the realm.

   o  "wamp.session.get": Retrieves information on a specific session.

   o  "wamp.session.kill": Kill a single session identified by session
      ID.

   o  "wamp.session.kill_by_authid": Kill all currently connected
      sessions that have the specified authid.

   o  "wamp.session.kill_by_authrole": Kill all currently connected
      sessions that have the specified authrole.

   o  "wamp.session.kill_all": Kill all currently connected sessions in
      the caller's realm.

   Session meta procedures MUST be registered by the _Router_ on the
   same realm as the WAMP session about which information is retrieved.

14.5.1.3.1.  wamp.session.count

   Obtains the number of sessions currently attached to the realm.

   *Positional arguments*

   1.  "filter_authroles|list[string]" - Optional filter: if provided,
       only count sessions with an "authrole" from this list.

   The caller of this meta procedure may only specify session IDs other
   than its own session.  Specifying the caller's own session will
   result in a "wamp.error.no_such_session" since no _other_ session
   with that ID exists.

14.5.2.  Authentication

   Authentication is a complex area.

   Some applications might want to leverage authentication information
   coming from the transport underlying WAMP, e.g.  HTTP cookies or TLS
   certificates.

   Some transports might imply trust or implicit authentication by their
   very nature, e.g.  Unix domain sockets with appropriate file system
   permissions in place.

   Other application might want to perform their own authentication
   using external mechanisms (completely outside and independent of
   WAMP).

   Some applications might want to perform their own authentication
   schemes by using basic WAMP mechanisms, e.g. by using application-
   defined remote procedure calls.

   And some applications might want to use a transport independent
   scheme, nevertheless predefined by WAMP.

14.5.2.1.  WAMP-level Authentication

   The message flow between Clients and Routers for establishing and
   tearing down sessions MAY involve the following messages which
   authenticate a session:

   1.  "CHALLENGE"

   2.  "AUTHENTICATE"

        ,------.          ,------.
        |Client|          |Router|
        `--+---'          `--+---'
           |      HELLO      |
           | ---------------->
           |                 |
           |    CHALLENGE    |
           | <----------------
           |                 |
           |   AUTHENTICATE  |
           | ---------------->
           |                 |
           | WELCOME or ABORT|
           | <----------------
        ,--+---.          ,--+---.
        |Client|          |Router|
        `------'          `------'

   Concrete use of "CHALLENGE" and "AUTHENTICATE" messages depends on
   the specific authentication method.

   See Section 14.5.2.3 or Section 14.5.2.4 for the use in these
   authentication methods.

   If two-factor authentication is desired, then two subsequent rounds
   of "CHALLENGE" and "RESPONSE" may be employed.

14.5.2.1.1.  CHALLENGE

   An authentication MAY be required for the establishment of a session.
   Such requirement MAY be based on the "Realm" the connection is
   requested for.

   To request authentication, the Router MUST send a "CHALLENGE" message
   to the _Endpoint_.

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


14.5.2.1.2.  AUTHENTICATE

   In response to a "CHALLENGE" message, the Client MUST send an
   "AUTHENTICATE" message.

       [AUTHENTICATE, Signature|string, Extra|dict]

   If the authentication succeeds, the Router MUST send a "WELCOME"
   message, else it MUST send an "ABORT" message.

14.5.2.2.  Transport-level Authentication

14.5.2.2.1.  Cookie-based Authentication

   When running WAMP over WebSocket, the transport provides HTTP client
   cookies during the WebSocket opening handshake.  The cookies can be
   used to authenticate one peer (the client) against the other (the
   server).  The other authentication direction cannot be supported by
   cookies.

   This transport-level authentication information may be forward to the
   WAMP level within "HELLO.Details.transport.auth|any" in the client-
   to-server direction.

14.5.2.2.2.  TLS Certificate Authentication

   When running WAMP over a TLS (either secure WebSocket or raw TCP)
   transport, a peer may authenticate to the other via the TLS
   certificate mechanism.  A server might authenticate to the client,
   and a client may authenticate to the server (TLS client-certificate
   based authentication).

   This transport-level authentication information may be forward to the
   WAMP level within "HELLO.Details.transport.auth|any" in both
   directions (if available).

14.5.2.3.  Challenge Response Authentication

   WAMP Challenge-Response ("WAMP-CRA") authentication is a simple,
   secure authentication mechanism using a shared secret.  The client
   and the server share a secret.  The secret never travels the wire,
   hence WAMP-CRA can be used via non-TLS connections.  The actual pre-
   sharing of the secret is outside the scope of the authentication
   mechanism.

   A typical authentication begins with the client sending a "HELLO"
   message specifying the "wampcra" method as (one of) the
   authentication methods:

           {
               "roles": ...,

               "authid": "peter"
           }
       ]

   The "HELLO.Details.authmethods|list" is used by the client to
   announce the authentication methods it is prepared to perform.  For
   WAMP-CRA, this MUST include ""wampcra"".

   The "HELLO.Details.authid|string" is the authentication ID (e.g.
   username) the client wishes to authenticate as.  For WAMP-CRA, this
   MUST be provided.

   If the server is unwilling or unable to perform WAMP-CRA
   authentication, it MAY either skip forward trying other
   authentication methods (if the client announced any) or send an
   "ABORT" message.

   If the server is willing to let the client authenticate using WAMP-
   CRA, and the server recognizes the provided "authid", it MUST send a
   "CHALLENGE" message:

       [4, "wampcra",
           {
               "challenge": "{ \"nonce\": \"LHRTC9zeOIrt_9U3\",
                   \"authprovider\": \"userdb\", \"authid\": \"peter\",
                   \"timestamp\": \"2014-06-22T16:36:25.448Z\",

                   \"session\": 3251278072152162}"
           }
       ]

   The "CHALLENGE.Details.challenge|string" is a string the client needs
   to create a signature for.  The string MUST BE a JSON serialized
   object which MUST contain:

   1.  "authid|string": The authentication ID the client will be
       authenticated as when the authentication succeeds.

   2.  "authrole|string": The authentication role the client will be
       authenticated as when the authentication succeeds.

   3.  "authmethod|string": The authentication methods, here ""wampcra""

   4.  "authprovider|string": The actual provider of authentication.
       For WAMP-CRA, this can be freely chosen by the app, e.g.
       "userdb".

   5.  "nonce|string": A random value.

   6.  "timestamp|string": The UTC timestamp (ISO8601 format) the
       authentication was started, e.g. "2014-06-22T16:51:41.643Z".

   7.  "session|int": The WAMP session ID that will be assigned to the
       session once it is authenticated successfully.

   The client needs to compute the signature as follows:

       signature := HMAC[SHA256]_{secret} (challenge)

   That is, compute the HMAC-SHA256 using the shared "secret" over the
   "challenge".

   After computing the signature, the client will send an "AUTHENTICATE"
   message containing the signature, as a base64-encoded string:

       [5, "gir1mSx+deCDUV7wRM5SGIn/+R/ClqLZuH4m7FJeBVI=", {}]

   The server will then check if

   o  the signature matches the one expected

   o  the "AUTHENTICATE" message was sent in due time

   If the authentication succeeds, the server will finally respond with
   a "WELCOME" message:

       [2, 3251278072152162,
           {
               "authid": "peter",

               "roles": ...
           }
       ]

   The "WELCOME.Details" again contain the actual authentication
   information active.

   If the authentication fails, the server will response with an "ABORT"
   message.

14.5.2.3.1.  Server-side Verification

   The challenge sent during WAMP-CRA contains

   1.  random information (the "nonce") to make WAMP-CRA robust against
       replay attacks

   2.  timestamp information (the "timestamp") to allow WAMP-CRA timeout
       on authentication requests that took too long

   3.  session information (the "session") to bind the authentication to
       a WAMP session ID

   4.  all the authentication information that relates to authorization
       like "authid" and "authrole"

14.5.2.3.2.  Three-legged Authentication

   The signing of the challenge sent by the server usually is done
   directly on the client.  However, this is no strict requirement.

   E.g. a client might forward the challenge to another party (hence the
   "three-legged") for creating the signature.  This can be used when
   the client was previously already authenticated to that third party,
   and WAMP-CRA should run piggy packed on that authentication.

   The third party would, upon receiving a signing request, simply check
   if the client is already authenticated, and if so, create a signature
   for WAMP-CRA.

   In this case, the secret is actually shared between the WAMP server
   who wants to authenticate clients using WAMP-CRA and the third party
   server, who shares a secret with the WAMP server.

   This scenario is also the reason the challenge sent with WAMP-CRA is
   not simply a random value, but a JSON serialized object containing
   sufficient authentication information for the third party to check.

14.5.2.3.3.  Password Salting

   WAMP-CRA operates using a shared secret.  While the secret is never
   sent over the wire, a shared secret often requires storage of that
   secret on the client and the server - and storing a password verbatim
   (unencrypted) is not recommended in general.

   WAMP-CRA allows the use of salted passwords following the PBKDF2 [5]
   key derivation scheme.  With salted passwords, the password itself is
   never stored, but only a key derived from the password and a password

   salt.  This derived key is then practically working as the new shared
   secret.

   When the password is salted, the server will during WAMP-CRA send a
   "CHALLENGE" message containing additional information:

       [4, "wampcra",
           {
               "challenge": "{ \"nonce\": \"LHRTC9zeOIrt_9U3\",
                   \"authprovider\": \"userdb\", \"authid\": \"peter\",
                   \"timestamp\": \"2014-06-22T16:36:25.448Z\",
                   \"authrole\": \"user\", \"authmethod\": \"wampcra\",
                   \"session\": 3251278072152162}",
               "salt": "salt123",
               "keylen": 32,
               "iterations": 1000
           }
       ]

   The "CHALLENGE.Details.salt|string" is the password salt in use.  The
   "CHALLENGE.Details.keylen|int" and "CHALLENGE.Details.iterations|int"
   are parameters for the PBKDF2 algorithm.

14.5.2.4.  Ticket-based Authentication

   With _Ticket-based authentication_, the client needs to present the
   server an authentication "ticket" - some magic value to authenticate
   itself to the server.

   This "ticket" could be a long-lived, pre-agreed secret (e.g. a user
   password) or a short-lived authentication token (like a Kerberos
   token).  WAMP does not care or interpret the ticket presented by the
   client.

      Caution: This scheme is extremely simple and flexible, but the
      resulting security may be limited.  E.g., the ticket value will be
      sent over the wire.  If the transport WAMP is running over is not
      encrypted, a man-in-the-middle can sniff and possibly hijack the
      ticket.  If the ticket value is reused, that might enable replay
      attacks.

   A typical authentication begins with the client sending a "HELLO"
   message specifying the "ticket" method as (one of) the authentication
   methods:

         {
           "roles": ...,
           "authmethods": ["ticket"],
           "authid": "joe"
         }
       ]

   The "HELLO.Details.authmethods|list" is used by the client to
   announce the authentication methods it is prepared to perform.  For
   Ticket-based, this MUST include ""ticket"".

   The "HELLO.Details.authid|string" is the authentication ID (e.g.
   username) the client wishes to authenticate as.  For Ticket-based
   authentication, this MUST be provided.

   If the server is unwilling or unable to perform Ticket-based
   authentication, it'll either skip forward trying other authentication
   methods (if the client announced any) or send an "ABORT" message.

   If the server is willing to let the client authenticate using a
   ticket and the server recognizes the provided "authid", it'll send a
   "CHALLENGE" message:

       [4, "ticket", {}]

   The client will send an "AUTHENTICATE" message containing a ticket:

       [5, "secret!!!", {}]

   The server will then check if the ticket provided is permissible (for
   the "authid" given).

   If the authentication succeeds, the server will finally respond with
   a "WELCOME" message:

       [2, 3251278072152162,
         {
           "authid": "joe",

       For Ticket-based authentication, this can be freely chosen by the
       app, e.g. "static" or "dynamic".

   The "WELCOME.Details" again contain the actual authentication
   information active.  If the authentication fails, the server will
   response with an "ABORT" message.

14.5.2.5.  Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism

   The WAMP Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism ("WAMP-
   SCRAM"), is a password-based authentication method where the shared
   secret is neither transmitted nor stored as cleartext.  WAMP-SCRAM is
   based on RFC5802 [6] (_Salted Challenge Response Authentication
   Mechanism_) and RFC7677 [7] (_SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS_).

   WAMP-SCRAM supports the Argon2 (draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2 [8]) password-
   based key derivation function, a memory-hard algorithm intended to
   resist cracking on GPU hardware.  PBKDF2 (RFC2898 [9]) is also
   supported for applications that are required to use primitives
   currently approved by cryptographic standards.

14.5.2.5.1.  Security Considerations

   With WAMP-SCRAM, if the authentication database is stolen, an
   attacker cannot impersonate a user unless they guess the password
   offline by brute force.

   In the event that the server's authentication database is stolen, and
   the attacker either eavesdrops on one authentication exchange or
   impersonates a server, the attacker gains the ability to impersonate
   that particular user on that server.  If the same salt is used on
   other servers, the attacker would gain the ability to impersonate
   that user on all servers using the same salt.  That's why it's
   important to use a per-user random salt.

   An eavesdropper that captures a user authentication exchange has
   enough information to mount an offline, brute-force dictionary attack
   for that particular user.  If passwords are sufficiently strong, the
   cost/time needed to crack a password becomes prohibitive.

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   Note that when HTML/JavaScript assets are served to a web browser,
   WAMP-SCRAM does not safeguard against a man-in-the-middle tampering
   with those assets.  Those assets could be tampered with in a way that
   captures the user's password and sends it to the attacker.

   In light of the above security concerns, a secure TLS transport is
   therefore advised to prevent such attacks.  The channel binding
   feature of SCRAM can be used to ensure that the TLS endpoints are the
   same between client and router.

14.5.2.5.2.  Deviations from RFC5802

   1.  To simplify parsing, SCRAM attributes in the authentication
       exchange messages are encoded as members of the
       "Options"/"Details" objects without escaping the "," and "="
       characters.  However, the "AuthMessage" used to compute the
       client and server signatures DOES use the exact syntax specified
       in RFC5802, section 7 [10].  This makes it possible to use
       existing test vectors to verify WAMP-SCRAM implementations.

   2.  Hashing based on the weaker SHA-1 specified in RFC5802 [11] is
       intentionally not supported by WAMP-SCRAM, in favor of the
       stronger SHA-256 specified in RFC7677 [12].

   3.  The Argon2 [13] key derivation function MAY be used instead of
       PBKDF2.

   4.  Nonces are required to be base64-encoded, which is stricter than
       the "printable" syntax specification of RFC5802 [14].

   5.  The ""y"" channel binding flag is not used as there is currently
       no standard way for WAMP routers to announce channel binding
       capabilities.

   6.  The use of "authzid" for user impersonation is not supported.

14.5.2.5.3.  authmethod Type String

   ""wamp-scram"" SHALL be used as the "authmethod" type string for
   WAMP-SCRAM authentication.  Announcement by routers of WAMP-SCRAM
   support is outside the scope of this document.

14.5.2.5.4.1.  Base64 encoding

   Base64 encoding of octet strings is restricted to canonical form with
   no whitespace, as defined in RFC4648 [15] (_The Base16, Base32, and
   Base64 Data Encodings_).

14.5.2.5.4.2.  Nonces

   In WAMP-SCRAM, a _nonce_ (number used once) is a base64-encoded
   sequence of random octets.  It SHOULD be of sufficient length to make
   a replay attack unfeasible.  A length of 16 octets (128 bits) is
   recommended for each of the client and server-generated nonces.

   See RFC4086 [16] (_Randomness Requirements for Security_) for best
   practices concerning randomness.

14.5.2.5.4.3.  Salts

   A _salt_ is a base64-encoded sequence of random octets.

   To prevent rainbow table attacks in the event of database theft, the
   salt MUST be generated randomly by the server *for each user*. The
   random salt is stored with each user record in the authentication
   database.

14.5.2.5.4.4.  Username/Password String Normalization

   Username and password strings SHALL be normalized according to the
   _SASLprep_ profile described in RFC4013 [17], using the _stringprep_
   algorithm described in RFC3454 [18].

   While SASLprep preserves the case of usernames, the server MAY choose
   to perform case insensitive comparisons when searching for a username
   in the authentication database.

14.5.2.5.5.  Channel Binding

   _Channel binding_ is a feature that allows a higher layer to
   establish that the other end of an underlying secure channel is bound
   to its higher layer counterpart.  See RFC5056 [19] (_On the Use of
   Channel Bindings_) for an in-depth discussion.

   RFC5929 [20] defines binding types for use with TLS transports, of
   which "tls-unique" and "tls-server-end-point" are applicable for
   WAMP-SCRAM.  For each channel binding type, there is a corresponding
   definition of the _channel binding data_ that must be sent in
   response to the authentication challenge.

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   Negotiation and announcement of channel binding is outside the scope
   of this document.  RFC5929 section 6 [21] recommends that application
   protocols use "tls-unique" exclusively, except perhaps where server-
   side proxies are commonly deployed.

   Note that WAMP-SCRAM channel binding is not generally possible with
   web browser clients due to the lack of a suitable API for this
   purpose.

14.5.2.5.5.1.  The tls-unique Channel Binding Type

   The "tls-unique" channel binding type allows the WAMP layer to
   establish that the other peer is authenticating over the same, unique
   TLS connection.  The channel binding data for this type corresponds
   to the bytes of the first TLS Finished message, as described in
   RFC5929, section 3 [22].  RFC5929 section 10.2 [23] addresses the
   concern of disclosing this data over the TLS channel (in short, the
   TLS Finished message would already be visible to eavesdroppers).

   To safeguard against the _triple handshake attack_ described in
   RFC7627 [24], this channel binding type MUST be used over a TLS
   channel that uses the _extended master secret_ extension, or over a
   TLS channel where session resumption is not permitted.

14.5.2.5.5.2.  The tls-server-end-point Channel Binding Type

   The "tls-server-end-point" channel binding type allows the WAMP layer
   to establish that the other peer is authenticating over a TLS
   connection to a server having been issued a Public Key Infrastructure
   Certificate.  The channel binding data for this type is a hash of the
   TLS server's certificate, computed as described in RFC5929, section
   4.1 [25].  The certificate is hashed to accommodate memory-
   constrained implementations.

14.5.2.5.6.  Authentication Exchange

   WAMP-SCRAM uses a single round of challenge/response pairs after the
   client authentication request and before the authentication outcome.

   The mapping of RFC5802 messages to WAMP messages is as follows:

   +--------------------------------------------+----------------+

14.5.2.5.6.1.  Initial Client Authentication Message

   WAMP-SCRAM authentication begins with the client sending a "HELLO"
   message specifying the "wamp-scram" method as (one of) the
   authentication methods:

       [1, "realm1",
           {
               "roles": ...,
               "authmethods": ["wamp-scram"],
               "authid": "user",
               "authextra":
                   {
                       "nonce": "egVDf3DMJh0=",
                       "channel_binding": null
                   }

           }
       ]

   where:

   1.  "authid|string": The identity of the user performing
       authentication.  This corresponds to the "username" parameter in
       RFC5802.

   2.  "authextra.nonce|string": A base64-encoded sequence of random
       octets, generated by the client.  See Section 14.5.2.5.4.2.

   3.  "authextra.channel_binding|string": Optional string containing
       the desired channel binding type.  See Section 14.5.2.5.5.

   Upon receiving the "HELLO" message, the server MUST terminate the
   authentication process by sending an "ABORT" message under any of the
   following circumstances:

   o  The server does not support the WAMP-SCRAM "authmethods", and
      there are no other methods left that the server supports for this
      "authid".

   o  The the server does not support the requested "channel_binding"
      type.

   o  (Optional) The server does not recognize the given "authid".  In
      this case, the server MAY proceed with a mock "CHALLENGE" message
      to avoid leaking information on the existence of usernames.  This
      mock "CHALLENGE" SHOULD contain a generated "salt" value that is
      always the same for a given "authid", otherwise an attacker may
      discover that the user doesn't actually exist.

14.5.2.5.6.2.  Initial Server Authentication Message

   If none of the above failure conditions apply, and the server is
   ready to let the client authenticate using WAMP-SCRAM, then it SHALL
   send a "CHALLENGE" message:

       [4, "wamp-scram",
           {
               "nonce": "egVDf3DMJh0=SBmkFIh7sSo=",
               "salt": "aBc+fx0NAVA=",
               "kdf": "pbkdf2",
               "iterations": 4096,
               "memory": null
           }
       ]

   where:

   1.  "nonce|string": A server-generated nonce that is appended to the
       client-generated nonce sent in the previous "HELLO" message.  See
       Section 14.5.2.5.4.2.

   2.  "salt|string": The base64-encoded salt for this user, to be
       passed to the key derivation function.  This value is stored with
       each user record in the authentication database.  See
       Section 14.5.2.5.4.3.

   3.  "kdf": The key derivation function (KDF) used to hash the
       password.  This value is stored with each user record in the
       authentication database.  See Section 14.5.2.5.8.

   4.  "iterations|integer": The execution time cost factor to use for
       generating the "SaltedPassword" hash.  This value is stored with
       each user record in the authentication database.

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   5.  "memory|integer": The memory cost factor to use for generating
       the "SaltedPassword" hash.  This is only used by the Argon2 key
       derivation function, where it is stored with each user record in
       the authentication database.

   The client MUST respond with an ABORT message if
   "CHALLENGE.Details.nonce" does not begin with the client nonce sent
   in "HELLO.Details.nonce".

   The client SHOULD respond with an ABORT message if it detects that
   the cost parameters are unusually low.  Such low-cost parameters
   could be the result of a rogue server attempting to obtain a weak
   password hash that can be easily cracked.  What constitutes unusually
   low parameters is implementation-specific and is not covered by this
   document.

14.5.2.5.6.3.  Final Client Authentication Message

   Upon receiving a valid "CHALLENGE" message, the client SHALL respond
   with an "AUTHENTICATE" message:

       [5, "dHzbZapWIk4jUhN+Ute9ytag9zjfMHgsqmmiz7AndVQ=",
           {
               "nonce": "egVDf3DMJh0=SBmkFIh7sSo=",
               "channel_binding": null,
               "cbind_data": null
           }
       ]

   where:

   1.  "Signature|string" argument: The base64-encoded "ClientProof",
       computed as described in the Section 14.5.2.5.7 section.

   2.  "nonce|string": The concatenated client-server nonce from the
       previous "CHALLENGE" message.

   3.  "channel_binding|string": Optional string containing the channel
       binding type that was sent in the original "HELLO" message.

   4.  "cbind_data|string": Optional base64-encoded channel binding
       data.  MUST be present if and only if "channel_binding" is not
       "null".  The format of the binding data is dependent on the
       binding type.  See Section 14.5.2.5.5.

   Upon receiving the "AUTHENTICATE" message, the server SHALL then
   check that:

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   o  The "AUTHENTICATE" message was received in due time.

   o  The "ClientProof" passed via the "Signature|string" argument is
      validated against the "StoredKey" and "ServerKey" stored in the
      authentication database.  See Section 14.5.2.5.7.

   o  "nonce" matches the one previously sent via "CHALLENGE".

   o  The "channel_binding" matches the one sent in the "HELLO" message.

   o  The "cbind_data" sent by the client matches the channel binding
      data that the server sees on its side of the channel.

14.5.2.5.6.4.  Final Server Authentication Message - Success

   If the authentication succeeds, the server SHALL finally respond with
   a "WELCOME" message:

      [2, 3251278072152162,
          {
              "authid": "user",
              "authrole": "frontend",
              "authmethod": "wamp-scram",
              "authprovider": "static",
              "roles": ...,
              "authextra":
                  {
                      "verifier":
                        "v=6rriTRBi23WpRR/wtup+mMhUZUn/dB5nLTJRsjl95G4="
                  }
          }
      ]

   where:

   1.  "authid|string": The authentication ID the client was actually
       authenticated as.

   2.  "authrole|string": The authentication role the client was
       authenticated for.

   3.  "authmethod|string": The authentication method, here ""wamp-
       scram"".

   4.  "authprovider|string": The actual provider of authentication.
       For WAMP-SCRAM authentication, this can be freely chosen by the
       app, e.g. static or dynamic.

   5.  "authextra.verifier|string": The base64-encoded
       "ServerSignature", computed as described in the
       Section 14.5.2.5.7 section.

   The client SHOULD check the "verifier" for mutual authentication,
   terminating the session if invalid.

14.5.2.5.6.5.  Final Server Authentication Message - Failure

   If the authentication fails, the server SHALL respond with an "ABORT"
   message.

   The server MAY include a SCRAM-specific error string in the "ABORT"
   message as a "Details.scram" attribute.  SCRAM error strings are
   listed in RFC5802, section 7 [26], under "server-error-value".

14.5.2.5.7.  SCRAM Algorithms

   _This section is non-normative_.

   RFC5802 [27] specifies the algorithms used to compute the
   "ClientProof", "ServerSignature", "ServerKey", and "StoredKey" values
   referenced by this document.  Those algorithms are summarized here in
   pseudocode for reference.

14.5.2.5.7.1.  Notation

   o  ""="": The variable on the left-hand side is the result of the
      expression on the right-hand side.

   o  ""+"": String concatenation.

   o  "IfNull(attribute, value, else)": If the given "attribute" is
      absent or null, evaluates to the given "value", otherwise
      evaluates to the given "else" value.

   o  "Decimal(integer)": The decimal string representation of the given
      "integer".

   o  "Base64(octets)": Base64 encoding of the given octet sequence,
      restricted to canonical form with no whitespace, as defined in
      RFC4648 [28].

   o  "UnBase64(str)": Decode the given Base64 string into an octet
      sequence.

   o  "Normalize(str)": Normalize the given string using the SASLprep
      profile RFC4013 [29] of the "stringprep" algorithm RFC3454 [30].

   o  "XOR": The exclusive-or operation applied to each octet of the
      left and right-hand-side octet sequences.

   o  "SHA256(str)": The SHA-256 cryptographic hash function.

   o  "HMAC(key, str)": Keyed-hash message authentication code, as
      defined in RFC2104 [31], with SHA-256 as the underlying hash
      function.

   o  "KDF(str, salt, params...)": One of the supported key derivations
      function, with the output key length the same as the SHA-256
      output length (32 octets). "params..." are the additional
      parameters that are applicable for the function: "iterations" and
      "memory".

   o  "Escape(str)": Replace every occurrence of "","" and ""="" in the
      given string with ""=2C"" and ""=3D"" respectively.

14.5.2.5.7.2.  Data Stored on the Server

   For each user, the server needs to store:

   1.  A random, per-user salt.

   2.  The type string corresponding to the key derivation function
       (KDF) used to hash the password (e.g. ""argon2id13"").  This is
       needed to handle future revisions of the KDF, as well as allowing
       migration to stronger KDFs that may be added to WAMP-SCRAM in the
       future.  This may also be needed if the KDF used during user
       registration is configurable or selectable on a per-user basis.

   3.  Parameters that are applicable to the key derivation function :
       "iterations" and possibly "memory".

   4.  The "StoredKey".

   5.  The "ServerKey".

   where "StoredKey" and "ServerKey" are computed as follows:

   SaltedPassword  = KDF(Normalize(password), salt, params...)
   ClientKey       = HMAC(SaltedPassword, "Client Key")
   StoredKey       = SHA256(ClientKey)
   ServerKey       = HMAC(SaltedPassword, "Server Key")

   Note that ""Client Key"" and ""Server Key"" are string literals.

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   The manner in which the "StoredKey" and "ServerKey" are shared with
   the server during user registration is outside the scope of SCRAM and
   this document.

14.5.2.5.7.3.  AuthMessage

   In SCRAM, "AuthMessage" is used for computing "ClientProof" and
   "ServerSignature".  "AuthMessage" is computed using attributes that
   were sent in the first three messages of the authentication exchange.

   ClientFirstBare = "n=" + Escape(HELLO.Details.authid) + "," +
                     "r=" + HELLO.Details.authextra.nonce

   ServerFirst = "r=" + CHALLENGE.Details.nonce + "," +
                 "s=" + CHALLENGE.Details.salt + "," +
                 "i=" + Decimal(CHALLENGE.Details.iterations)

   CBindName = AUTHENTICATE.Extra.channel_binding

   CBindData = AUTHENTICATE.Extra.cbind_data

   CBindFlag = IfNull(CBindName, "n", "p=" + CBindName)

   CBindInput = CBindFlag + ",," +
                IfNull(CBindData, "", UnBase64(CBindData))

   ClientFinalNoProof = "c=" + Base64(CBindInput) + "," +
                        "r=" + AUTHENTICATE.Extra.nonce

   AuthMessage = ClientFirstBare + "," + ServerFirst + "," +
                 ClientFinalNoProof

14.5.2.5.7.4.  ClientProof

   "ClientProof" is computed by the client during the authentication
   exchange as follows:

   SaltedPassword  = KDF(Normalize(password), salt, params...)
   ClientKey       = HMAC(SaltedPassword, "Client Key")
   StoredKey       = SHA256(ClientKey)
   ClientSignature = HMAC(StoredKey, AuthMessage)
   ClientProof     = ClientKey XOR ClientSignature

   The "ClientProof" is then sent to the server, base64-encoded, via the
   "AUTHENTICATE.Signature" argument.

   The server verifies the "ClientProof" by computing the
   "RecoveredStoredKey" and comparing it to the actual "StoredKey":



Oberstein & Goedde      Expires October 20, 2018              [Page 142]

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   ClientSignature    = HMAC(StoredKey, AuthMessage)
   RecoveredClientKey = ClientSignature XOR ReceivedClientProof
   RecoveredStoredKey = SHA256(RecoveredClientKey)

   Note that the client MAY cache the "ClientKey" and "StoredKey" (or
   just "SaltedPassword") to avoid having to perform the expensive KDF
   computation for every authentication exchange.  Storing these values
   securely on the client is outside the scope of this document.

14.5.2.5.7.5.  ServerSignature

   "ServerSignature" is computed by the server during the authentication
   exchange as follows:

   ServerSignature = HMAC(ServerKey, AuthMessage)

   The "ServerSignature" is then sent to the client, base64-encoded, via
   the "WELCOME.Details.authextra.verifier" attribute.

   The client verifies the "ServerSignature" by computing it and
   comparing it with the "ServerSignature" sent by the server:

   ServerKey       = HMAC(SaltedPassword, "Server Key")
   ServerSignature = HMAC(ServerKey, AuthMessage)

14.5.2.5.8.  Key Derivation Functions

   SCRAM uses a password-based key derivation function (KDF) to hash
   user passwords.  WAMP-SCRAM supports both Argon2 [32] and PBKDF2 [33]
   as the KDF.  Argon2 is recommended because of its memory hardness and
   resistance against GPU hardware.  PBKDF2, which does not feature
   memory hardness, is also supported for applications that are required
   to use primitives currently approved by cryptographic standards.

   The following table maps the "CHALLENGE.Details.kdf" type string to
   the corresponding KDF.

       +-----------------+-----------------------------------------+
       | KDF type string |                 Function                |
       +-----------------+-----------------------------------------+
       |  ""argon2id13"" | Argon2id variant of Argon2, version 1.3 |
       |    ""pbkdf2""   |                  PBKDF2                 |
       +-----------------+-----------------------------------------+

   To promote interoperability, WAMP-SCRAM client/server implementations
   SHOULD support both of the above KDFs.  During authentication, there
   is no "negotiation" of the KDF, and the client MUST use the same KDF




Oberstein & Goedde      Expires October 20, 2018              [Page 143]

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   than the one used to create the keys stored in the authentication
   database.

   Which KDF is used to hash the password during user registration is up
   to the application and/or server implementation, and is not covered
   by this document.  Possibilities include:

   o  making the KDF selectable at runtime during registration,

   o  making the KDF statically configurable on the server, or,

   o  hard-coding the KDF selection on the server.

14.5.2.5.8.1.  Argon2

   The Argon2 key derivation function, proposed in draft-irtf-cfrg-
   argon2 [34], is computed using the following parameters:

   o  "CHALLENGE.Details.salt" as the cryptographic salt,

   o  "CHALLENGE.Details.iterations" as the number of iterations,

   o  "CHALLENGE.Details.memory" as the memory size (in kibibytes),

   o  1 as the parallelism parameter,

   o  Argon2id as the algorithm variant, and,

   o  32 octets as the output key length.

   For WAMP-SCRAM, the parallelism parameter is fixed to 1 due to the
   password being hashed on the client side, where it is not generally
   known how many cores/threads are available on the client's device.

   Section 4 of the Argon2 internet draft recommends the general
   procedure for selecting parameters, of which the following guidelines
   are applicable to WAMP-SCRAM:

   o  A 128-bit salt is recommended, which can be reduced to 64-bit if
      space is limited.

   o  The "memory" parameter is to be configured to the maximum amount
      of memory usage that can be tolerated on client devices for
      computing the hash.

   o  The "iterations" parameter is to be determined experimentally so
      that execution time on the client reaches the maximum that can be
      tolerated by users during authentication.  If the execution time

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


      is intolerable with "iterations" = 1, then reduce the "memory"
      parameter as needed.

14.5.2.5.8.2.  PBKDF2

   The PBKDF2 key derivation function, defined in RFC2898 [35], is used
   with SHA-256 as the pseudorandom function (PRF).

   The PDBKDF2 hash is computed using the following parameters:

   o  "CHALLENGE.Details.salt" as the cryptographic salt,

   o  "CHALLENGE.Details.iterations" as the iteration count, and,

   o  32 octets as the output key length ("dkLen"), which matches the
      SHA-256 output length.

   RFC2898 section 4.1 [36] recommends at least 64 bits for the salt.

   The "iterations" parameter SHOULD be determined experimentally so
   that execution time on the client reaches the maximum that can be
   tolerated by users during authentication.  RFC7677 section 4 [37]
   recommends an iteration count of at least 4096, with a significantly
   higher value on non-mobile clients.

14.5.3.  Alternative Transports

   The only requirements that WAMP expects from a transport are: the
   transport must be message-based, bidirectional, reliable and ordered.
   This allows WAMP to run over different transports without any impact
   at the application layer.

   Besides the WebSocket transport, the following WAMP transports are
   currently specified:

   o  Section 14.5.3.1

   o  Section 14.5.3.2

   o  Section 14.5.3.3

   o  Section 14.5.3.4

      Other transports such as HTTP 2.0 ("SPDY") or UDP might be defined
      in the future.

14.5.3.1.  RawSocket Transport

   *WAMP-over-RawSocket* is an (alternative) transport for WAMP that
   uses length-prefixed, binary messages - a message framing different
   from WebSocket.

   Compared to WAMP-over-WebSocket, WAMP-over-RawSocket is simple to
   implement, since there is no need to implement the WebSocket protocol
   which has some features that make it non-trivial (like a full HTTP-
   based opening handshake, message fragmentation, masking and variable
   length integers).

   WAMP-over-RawSocket has even lower overhead than WebSocket, which can
   be desirable in particular when running on local connections like
   loopback TCP or Unix domain sockets.  It is also expected to allow
   implementations in microcontrollers in under 2KB RAM.

   WAMP-over-RawSocket can run over TCP, TLS, Unix domain sockets or any
   reliable streaming underlying transport.  When run over TLS on the
   standard port for secure HTTPS (443), it is also able to traverse
   most locked down networking environments such as enterprise or mobile
   networks (unless man-in-the-middle TLS intercepting proxies are in
   use).

   However, WAMP-over-RawSocket cannot be used with Web browser clients,
   since browsers do not allow raw TCP connections.  Browser extensions
   would do, but those need to be installed in a browser.  WAMP-over-
   RawSocket also (currently) does not support transport-level
   compression as WebSocket does provide ("permessage-deflate" WebSocket
   extension).

14.5.3.1.1.  Endianess

   WAMP-over-RawSocket uses _network byte order_ ("big-endian").  That
   means, given a unsigned 32 bit integer

       0x 11 22 33 44

   the first octet sent out to (or received from) the wire is "0x11" and
   the last octet sent out (or received) is "0x44".

   Here is how you would convert octets received from the wire into an
   integer in Python:

       import struct

       octets_received = b"\x11\x22\x33\x44"
       i = struct.unpack(">L", octets_received)[0]
       <CODE ENDS>

   The integer received has the value "287454020".

   And here is how you would send out an integer to the wire in Python:

       <CODE BEGINS>
       octets_to_be_send = struct.pack(">L", i)
       <CODE ENDS>

   The octets to be sent are "b"\x11\x22\x33\x44"".

14.5.3.1.2.  Handshake

   *Client-to-Router Request*

   WAMP-over-RawSocket starts with a handshake where the client
   connecting to a router sends 4 octets:

       MSB                                 LSB
       31                                    0
       0111 1111 LLLL SSSS RRRR RRRR RRRR RRRR

   The _first octet_ is a magic octet with value "0x7F".  This value is
   chosen to avoid any possible collision with the first octet of a
   valid HTTP request (see here [38] and here [39]).  No valid HTTP
   request can have "0x7F" as its first octet.

      By using a magic first octet that cannot appear in a regular HTTP
      request, WAMP-over-RawSocket can be run e.g. on the same TCP
      listening port as WAMP-over-WebSocket or WAMP-over-LongPoll.

   The _second octet_ consists of a 4 bit "LENGTH" field and a 4 bit
   "SERIALIZER" field.

   The "LENGTH" value is used by the _Client_ to signal the *maximum
   message length* of messages it is willing to *receive*. When the
   handshake completes successfully, a _Router_ MUST NOT send messages
   larger than this size.

   The possible values for "LENGTH" are:

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


        0: 2**9 octets
        1: 2**10 octets
       ...
       15: 2**24 octets

   This means a _Client_ can choose the maximum message length between
   *512* and *16M* octets.

   The "SERIALIZER" value is used by the _Client_ to request a specific
   serializer to be used.  When the handshake completes successfully,
   the _Client_ and _Router_ will use the serializer requested by the
   _Client_.

   The possible values for "SERIALIZER" are:

       0: illegal
       1: JSON
       2: MessagePack
       3 - 15: reserved for future serializers

   Here is a Python program that prints all (currently) permissible
   values for the _second octet_:

        <CODE BEGINS>
        SERMAP = {
           1: 'json',
           2: 'messagepack'
        }

        ## map serializer / max. msg length to RawSocket handshake
        ## request or success reply (2nd octet)
        ##
        for ser in SERMAP:
           for l in range(16):
              octet_2 = (l << 4) | ser
              print("serializer: {}, maxlen: {} =>
                  0x{:02x}".format(SERMAP[ser], 2 ** (l + 9), octet_2))
        <CODE ENDS>

   The _third and forth octet_ are *reserved* and MUST be all zeros for
   now.

   *Router-to-Client Reply*

   After a _Client_ has connected to a _Router_, the _Router_ will first
   receive the 4 octets handshake request from the _Client_.

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


   If the _first octet_ differs from "0x7F", it is not a WAMP-over-
   RawSocket request.  Unless the _Router_ also supports other
   transports on the connecting port (such as WebSocket or LongPoll),
   the _Router_ MUST *fail the connection*.

   Here is an example of how a _Router_ could parse the _second octet_
   in a _Clients_ handshake request:

       <CODE BEGINS>
       ## map RawSocket handshake request (2nd octet) to
       ## serializer / max. msg length
       ##
       for i in range(256):
          ser_id = i & 0x0f
          if ser_id != 0:
             ser = SERMAP.get(ser_id, 'currently undefined')
             maxlen = 2 ** ((i >> 4) + 9)
             print("{:02x} => serializer: {}, maxlen: {}".
                 format(i, ser, maxlen))
          else:
             print("fail the connection: illegal serializer value")
       <CODE ENDS>

   When the _Router_ is willing to speak the serializer requested by the
   _Client_, it will answer with a 4 octets response of identical
   structure as the _Client_ request:

       MSB                                 LSB
       31                                    0
       0111 1111 LLLL SSSS RRRR RRRR RRRR RRRR

   Again, the _first octet_ MUST be the value "0x7F".  The _third and
   forth octets_ are reserved and MUST be all zeros for now.

   In the _second octet_, the _Router_ MUST echo the serializer value in
   "SERIALIZER" as requested by the _Client_.

   Similar to the _Client_, the _Router_ sets the "LENGTH" field to
   request a limit on the length of messages sent by the _Client_.

   During the connection, _Router_ MUST NOT send messages to the
   _Client_ longer than the "LENGTH" requested by the _Client_, and the
   _Client_ MUST NOT send messages larger than the maximum requested by
   the _Router_ in its handshake reply.

   If a message received during a connection exceeds the limit
   requested, a _Peer_ MUST *fail the connection*.

   When the _Router_ is unable to speak the serializer requested by the
   _Client_, or it is denying the _Client_ for other reasons, the
   _Router_ replies with an error:

       MSB                                 LSB
       31                                    0
       0111 1111 EEEE 0000 RRRR RRRR RRRR RRRR

   An error reply has 4 octets: the _first octet_ is again the magic
   "0x7F", and the _third and forth octet_ are reserved and MUST all be
   zeros for now.

   The _second octet_ has its lower 4 bits zero'ed (which distinguishes
   the reply from an success/accepting reply) and the upper 4 bits
   encode the error:

       0: illegal (must not be used)
       1: serializer unsupported
       2: maximum message length unacceptable
       3: use of reserved bits (unsupported feature)
       4: maximum connection count reached
       5 - 15: reserved for future errors

      Note that the error code "0" MUST NOT be used.  This is to allow
      storage of error state in a host language variable, while allowing
      "0" to signal the current state "no error"

   Here is an example of how a _Router_ might create the _second octet_
   in an error response:

       <CODE BEGINS>
       ERRMAP = {
          0: "illegal (must not be used)",
          1: "serializer unsupported",
          2: "maximum message length unacceptable",
          3: "use of reserved bits (unsupported feature)",
          4: "maximum connection count reached"
       }

       ## map error to RawSocket handshake error reply (2nd octet)
       ##
       for err in ERRMAP:
          octet_2 = err << 4
          print("error: {} => 0x{:02x}").format(ERRMAP[err], err)
       <CODE ENDS>

   The _Client_ - after having sent its handshake request - will wait
   for the 4 octets from _Router_ handshake reply.

14.5.3.1.3.  Serialization

   To send a WAMP message, the message is serialized according to the
   WAMP serializer agreed in the handshake (e.g.  JSON or MessagePack).

   The length of the serialized messages in octets MUST NOT exceed the
   maximum requested by the _Peer_.

   If the serialized length exceed the maximum requested, the WAMP
   message can not be sent to the _Peer_. Handling situations like the
   latter is left to the implementation.

   E.g. a _Router_ that is to forward a WAMP "EVENT" to a _Client_ which
   exceeds the maximum length requested by the _Client_ when serialized
   might:

   o  drop the event (not forwarding to that specific client) and track
      dropped events

   o  prohibit publishing to the topic already

   o  remove the event payload, and send an event with extra information
      ("payload_limit_exceeded = true")

14.5.3.1.4.  Framing

   The serialized octets for a message to be sent are prefixed with
   exactly 4 octets.

       MSB                                 LSB
       31                                    0
       RRRR RTTT LLLL LLLL LLLL LLLL LLLL LLLL

   The _first octet_ has the following structure

       MSB   LSB
       7       0
       RRRR RTTT

   The five bits "RRRRR" are reserved for future use and MUST be all
   zeros for now.

   The three bits "TTT" encode the type of the transport message:

       0: regular WAMP message
       1: PING
       2: PONG
       3-7: reserved

   The _three remaining octets_ constitute an unsigned 24 bit integer
   that provides the length of transport message payload following,
   excluding the 4 octets that constitute the prefix.

   For a regular WAMP message ("TTT == 0"), the length is the length of
   the serialized WAMP message: the number of octets after serialization
   (excluding the 4 octets of the prefix).

   For a "PING" message ("TTT == 1"), the length is the length of the
   arbitrary payload that follows.  A _Peer_ MUST reply to each "PING"
   by sending exactly one "PONG" immediately, and the "PONG" MUST echo
   back the payload of the "PING" exactly.

   For receiving messages with WAMP-over-RawSocket, a _Peer_ will
   usually read exactly 4 octets from the incoming stream, decode the
   transport level message type and payload length, and then receive as
   many octets as the length was giving.

   When the transport level message type indicates a regular WAMP
   message, the transport level message payload is unserialized
   according to the serializer agreed in the handshake and the processed
   at the WAMP level.

14.5.3.2.  Batched WebSocket Transport for WAMP

   _WAMP-over-Batched-WebSocket_ is a variant of WAMP-over-WebSocket
   where multiple WAMP messages are sent in one WebSocket message.

   Using WAMP message batching can increase wire level efficiency
   further.  In particular when using TLS and the WebSocket
   implementation is forcing every WebSocket message into a new TLS
   segment.

   WAMP-over-Batched-WebSocket is negotiated between Peers in the
   WebSocket opening handshake by agreeing on one of the following
   WebSocket subprotocols:

   o  "wamp.2.json.batched"

   o  "wamp.2.msgpack.batched"

   Batching with JSON works by serializing each WAMP message to JSON as
   normally, appending the single ASCII control character "\30" (record
   separator [40]) octet "0x1e" to _each_ serialized messages, and
   packing a sequence of such serialized messages into a single
   WebSocket message:

       Serialized JSON WAMP Msg 1 | 0x1e |
           Serialized JSON WAMP Msg 2 | 0x1e | ...

   Batching with MessagePack works by serializing each WAMP message to
   MessagePack as normally, prepending a 32 bit unsigned integer (4
   octets in big-endian byte order) with the length of the serialized
   MessagePack message (excluding the 4 octets for the length prefix),
   and packing a sequence of such serialized (length-prefixed) messages
   into a single WebSocket message:

       Length of Msg 1 serialization (uint32) |
           serialized MessagePack WAMP Msg 1 | ...

   With batched transport, even if only a single WAMP message is to be
   sent in a WebSocket message, the (single) WAMP message needs to be
   framed as described above.  In other words, a single WAMP message is
   sent as a batch of length *1*. Sending a batch of length *0* (no WAMP
   message) is illegal and a _Peer_ MUST fail the transport upon
   receiving such a transport message.

14.5.3.3.  A HTTP Longpoll Transport for WAMP

   The _Long-Poll Transport_ is able to transmit a WAMP session over
   plain old HTTP 1.0/1.1.  This is realized by the Client issuing HTTP/
   POSTs requests, one for sending, and one for receiving.  Those latter
   requests are kept open at the server when there are no messages
   currently pending to be received.

   *Opening a Session*

   With the Long-Poll Transport, a Client opens a new WAMP session by
   sending a HTTP/POST request to a well-known URL, e.g.

       http://mypp.com/longpoll/open

   Here, "http://mypp.com/longpoll" is the base URL for the Long-Poll
   Transport and "/open" is a path dedicated for opening new sessions.

   The HTTP/POST request SHOULD have a "Content-Type" header set to
   "application/json" and MUST have a request body with a JSON document
   that is a dictionary:

       {
          "protocols": ["wamp.2.json"]
       }

   The (mandatory) "protocols" attribute specifies the protocols the
   client is willing to speak.  The server will chose one from this list
   when establishing the session or fail the request when no protocol
   overlap was found.

   The valid protocols are:

   o  "wamp.2.json.batched"

   o  "wamp.2.json"

   o  "wamp.2.msgpack.batched"

   o  "wamp.2.msgpack"

      The request path with this and subsequently described HTTP/POST
      requests MAY contain a query parameter "x" with some random or
      sequentially incremented value:

      <http://mypp.com/longpoll/open?x=382913>

Internet-Draft                    WAMP                        April 2018


      The value is ignored, but may help in certain situations to
      prevent intermediaries from caching the request.

   Returned is a JSON document containing a transport ID and the
   protocol to speak:

       {
          "protocol": "wamp.2.json",
          "transport": "kjmd3sBLOUnb3Fyr"
       }

   As an implied side-effect, two HTTP endpoints are created

       http://mypp.com/longpoll/<transport_id>/receive
       http://mypp.com/longpoll/<transport_id>/send

   where "transport_id" is the transport ID returned from "open", e.g.

       http://mypp.com/longpoll/kjmd3sBLOUnb3Fyr/receive
       http://mypp.com/longpoll/kjmd3sBLOUnb3Fyr/send

   *Receiving WAMP Messages*

   The Client will then issue HTTP/POST requests (with empty request
   body) to

       http://mypp.com/longpoll/kjmd3sBLOUnb3Fyr/receive

   When there are WAMP messages pending downstream, a request will
   return with a single WAMP message (unbatched modes) or a batch of
   serialized WAMP messages (batched mode).

   The serialization format used is the one agreed during opening the
   session.

   The batching uses the same scheme as with "wamp.2.json.batched" and
   "wamp.2.msgpack.batched" transport over WebSocket.

      Note: In unbatched mode, when there is more than one message
      pending, there will be at most one message returned for each
      request.  The other pending messages must be retrieved by new
      requests.  With batched mode, all messages pending at request time
      will be returned in one batch of messages.

   *Sending WAMP Messages*

   For sending WAMP messages, the _Client_ will issue HTTP/POST requests
   to

       http://mypp.com/longpoll/kjmd3sBLOUnb3Fyr/send

   with request body being a single WAMP message (unbatched modes) or a
   batch of serialized WAMP messages (batched mode).

   The serialization format used is the one agreed during opening the
   session.

   The batching uses the same scheme as with "wamp.2.json.batched" and
   "wamp.2.msgpack.batched" transport over WebSocket.

   Upon success, the request will return with HTTP status code 202 ("no
   content").  Upon error, the request will return with HTTP status code
   400 ("bad request").

   *Closing a Session*

   To orderly close a session, a Client will issue a HTTP/POST to

       http://mypp.com/longpoll/kjmd3sBLOUnb3Fyr/close

   with an empty request body.  Upon success, the request will return
   with HTTP status code 202 ("no content").

14.5.3.4.  Multiplexed Transport

   A Transport may support the multiplexing of multiple logical
   transports over a single "physical" transport.

   By using such a Transport, multiple WAMP sessions can be transported
   over a single underlying transport at the same time.

   As an example, the proposed WebSocket extension "permessage-priority"
   [41] would allow creating multiple logical Transports for WAMP over a
   single underlying WebSocket connection.

   Sessions running over a multiplexed Transport are completely
   independent: they get assigned different session IDs, may join
   different realms and each session needs to authenticate itself.

   Because of above, Multiplexed Transports for WAMP are actually not
   detailed in the WAMP spec, but a feature of the transport being used.

      Note: Currently no WAMP transport supports multiplexing.  The work
      on the MUX extension with WebSocket has stalled, and the
      "permessage-priority" proposal above is still just a proposal.
      However, with RawSocket, we should be able to add multiplexing in
      the the future (with downward compatibility).

15.  Binary conversion of JSON Strings

   Binary data follows a convention for conversion to JSON strings.

   A byte array is converted to a JSON string as follows:

   1.  convert the byte array to a Base64 encoded (host language) string

   2.  prepend the string with a "\0" character

   3.  serialize the string to a JSON string

   where Base64 encoding follows Section 4 of [RFC4648].

   _Example_

   Consider the byte array (hex representation):

       10e3ff9053075c526f5fc06d4fe37cdb

   This will get converted to Base64

       EOP/kFMHXFJvX8BtT+N82w==

   prepended with "\0"

       \x00EOP/kFMHXFJvX8BtT+N82w==

   and serialized to a JSON string

       "\\u0000EOP/kFMHXFJvX8BtT+N82w=="

   A JSON string is unserialized to either a string or a byte array
   using the following procedure:

   1.  Unserialize a JSON string to a host language (Unicode) string

   2.  If the string starts with a "\0" character, interpret the rest
       (after the first character) as Base64 and decode to a byte array

   3.  Otherwise, return the Unicode string

   Below are complete Python and JavaScript code examples for conversion
   between byte arrays and JSON strings.

15.1.  Python

   Here is a complete example in Python showing how byte arrays are
   converted to and from JSON:

            <CODE BEGINS>

            import os, base64, json, sys, binascii
            PY3 = sys.version_info >= (3,)
            if PY3:
               unicode = str

            data_in = os.urandom(16)
            print("In:   {}".format(binascii.hexlify(data_in)))

            ## encoding
            encoded = json.dumps('\0' + base64.b64encode(data_in).
                                                  decode('ascii'))

            print("JSON: {}".format(encoded))

            ## decoding
            decoded = json.loads(encoded)
            if type(decoded) == unicode:
               if decoded[0] == '\0':
                  data_out = base64.b64decode(decoded[1:])
               else:
                  data_out = decoded

            print("Out:  {}".format(binascii.hexlify(data_out)))

            assert(data_out == data_in)

            <CODE ENDS>

15.2.  JavaScript

   Here is a complete example in JavaScript showing how byte arrays are
   converted to and from JSON:

        <CODE BEGINS>
        var data_in = new Uint8Array(new ArrayBuffer(16));

        // initialize test data
        for (var i = 0; i < data_in.length; ++i) {
           data_in[i] = i;
        }
        console.log(data_in);

        // convert byte array to raw string
        var raw_out = '';
        for (var i = 0; i < data_in.length; ++i) {
           raw_out += String.fromCharCode(data_in[i]);
        }

        // base64 encode raw string, prepend with \0
        // and serialize to JSON
        var encoded = JSON.stringify("\0" + window.btoa(raw_out));
        console.log(encoded); // "\u0000AAECAwQFBgcICQoLDA0ODw=="

        // unserialize from JSON
        var decoded = JSON.parse(encoded);

        var data_out;
        if (decoded.charCodeAt(0) === 0) {
           // strip first character and decode base64 to raw string
           var raw = window.atob(decoded.substring(1));

           // convert raw string to byte array
           var data_out = new Uint8Array(new ArrayBuffer(raw.length));
           for (var i = 0; i < raw.length; ++i) {
              data_out[i] = raw.charCodeAt(i);
           }
        } else {
           data_out = decoded;
        }

        console.log(data_out);
        <CODE ENDS>
